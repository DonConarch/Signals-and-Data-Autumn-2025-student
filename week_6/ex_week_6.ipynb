    "  <em>\"But wait, we already know about convolution using images and kernels?\"</em>\n",

    "Right you are, Harry! There is **next to no difference** from the convolution of images vs the convolution of signals. Where in convolution of images (usually called 2d convolution), you 'slide' a **kernel** across the image and calculate values like so. In signal convolution (usually called 1d convolution), you 'slide' a **filter** across the signal and calculate values. For a continuous signal, this looks like so **(Notice the filter has been flipped as to perform convolution and not cross-correlation)**:\n",

    "In both cases, plot of the filter (noted as \"Impulse response\" in continuous case, and \"Kernel\" in the discrete response), is what's called the **impulse response** of the filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanations of this usually involve fancy maths about delta functions and whatever, but basically it is **the output you get if you pass the filter over a function that consists of a single value** (called a delta, or Dirac delta function):\n",

    "\n",
    "And that's pretty much all there is to it... This is really cool since convolution is a rather slow operation, and fourier transforms are not (thanks to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT (a fast algorithm for getting a fourier transform not covered in this course))). That means, it is sometimes faster to take the FFT of a signal, multiply it with a filter, and take the inverse FFT, than it is to simply convolve the time domain version of the singal with the time domain filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another useful feature:** is that if you plot a filter in the frequency domain, it's impulse response will just show directly which frequencies will be attenuated or amplified, almost as a regular fourier transform plot would. An example we will see later plotted below:\n",

    "As mentioned, filtering is rather easy enough, we are going to focus on just convolution, plotting filters and using filters in time and frequency domain. As a reminder, the formula for signal convolution is\n",

    "\n",
    "### High-, low, and band-pass filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used filters, are usually some variant of high-pass filters, low-pass filters and band-pass filters. They work in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-pass**: Let the high frequencies pass, meaning the result is a signal with only high frequencies\n",
    "- **Low-pass**: Let the low frequencies pass, meaning the signal will only have low frequencies\n",
    "- **Band-pass**: Let frequencies in a specific band (for example 400 to 800 Hz) pass, meaning the signal will only have those frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at how these filters look in the **frequency domain**, it is roughly equal to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/actual_filters.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "Ignore the band-stop filter, it is not important for our purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**, these are in the frequency domain, so the x-axis will show *what* frequencies will be affected, and the y-axis will show how those frequencies will be affected by the filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if $h$ is our filter, $h(5) = 10$, for example, means that the amplitude of the frequency $5$ in our signal, will be multiplied by $10$ after applying the filter $h$\n",

Take that as a lesson, that if someone else has done it, it is probably better than what you can make yourself*\n",
