    "# Week 9 - Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings is a very popular an effective manner of giving ML models a sort of background knowledge of the vocabulary of a given document corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "A word embedding is effectively, just a learned vector representation for text. The vectors can be in any number of arbitrary dimensions $m$, but the rule of thumb is often, that larger vocabularies and more intricate patterns, require more dimensions. Often, (and in this case) the goal is to have the vector representations model words semantic meanings, so words with similar meaning in texts, have similar representations. An example could be the words \"cat\" and \"mouse\" having a small difference between them, when compared to a word such as \"prestidigitation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things in particular are cool about word embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can be used for downstream tasks; if you make a set of word embeddings using one dataset, they can most likely be used for other NLP applications, not even relevant to the original dataset on which the embeddings were trained.\n",
    "2. They often \"naturally\" appear in neural networks. The first few layers often create useful representations of words so that similar words have similar representations. This means, these initial neural network layers can be extracted for other downstream applications, something which [Skipgram and CBOW](https://medium.com/@RobuRishabh/learning-word-embeddings-with-cbow-and-skip-gram-b834bde18de4) models leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this week, you should be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what word embeddings are\n",
    "- Explain what a word co-occurence matrix is\n",
    "- Know how to compare words using cosine similarities\n",
    "- Explain hoa  GloVe word-embedding matrix looks roughly\n",
    "- Explain how word embedding vectors relate to one another for related words.\n",
    "- Reflect on how word embeddings can transmit societal bias \n",

    "## GloVE\n",
    "\n",
    "[GloVe: Gloval Vectors for Word Representations](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) is an unsupervised learning method to obtain vector representations for words. [The paper is available here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf). The group out of Stanford, have released numerous different models, we will work with one trained on Wikipedia 2014, which contains $400000$ words, each represented by a feature vector with a dimensionality of $50$. You can download the full vector dataset here: [http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe wasn't the first word embedding model, and today, is probably not even the best. What was unique about them, was the way they mixed *local* and *global* representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With bag-of-words and LSA in week 7, for example, we only achived a global representation, words related if they were in the same document, no matter how far apart they were. In Skipgram and CBOW (as fasttext uses), only local contexts matter. Whether words share a document does not matter, so long as they do not share a local context. GloVe, via \"dark magic mathematics\" (not necessary to learn in-depth), mixes both of these. Moreover, they constrain their embeddings to have linear relationships between a lot of the words:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/linear_relationships.png\" alt=\"Centered Image\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning, simple additive or multiplicative operations should bring you somewhat closer to another word. To achieve this, they among other things, eschew the use of Neural networks to create the embeddings, as they are by design, nonlinaer. Meaning, even if they led to better embeddings, the relationship between different embeddings, could be decidedly nonlinear, and difficult to interpret by humans.\n",

    "\n",
    "An example of an analogy is;\n",
    "- *evening* is to *morning* as *dinner* is to *breakfast*\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogies are often used as verbal reasoning tests, where the test subject is asked to infer the similarity between two relations, by only being presented the first three terms of the analogy problem.\n",

    "- *brother* is to *sister* as *boy* is to *???*\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of problems are often included in assessments of intelligence (such as IQ or children development tests) as the ability to draw analogies are believed to reflect the underlying cognitive ability to represent and reason about higher-order relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you are going to examine an AI algorithm for solving such analogy problems. As input, the algorithm is given the first three terms of an analogy problem. It will then rely on the linear substructure of the GloVe word embedding to find and return the best candidate word for the forth term.\n",

    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "For a given problem, let $v_1,v_2,v_3$ be the vector representations for the first three terms. \n",
