    "\n",
    "This week'll focus on basic text representations using the **bag-of-words**-model (BoW). We will use this to, among other things perform **Latent semantic analysis** (LSA) using **Singular value decomposition** (SVD), and later, we'll do **sentiment analysis** of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the exercises may not seem all that difficult mathematically speaking, but are quite challenging from a code standpoint. As always, we encourage you to work with them, but not be afraid to skip exercises if they are too hard to code, or if you spend time purely on implementation work. **You will not be asked to write code for the exam.**. Even so, coding these exercises may be extremely useful for understanding the concepts that are behind this part of natural langauge processing.\n",

    "- Explain some up- and downsides of the bag-of-words-representation\n",
    "- Understand what the term-by-term and document-by-document matrices mean, and what their individual values mean.\n",
    "- Understand how LSA is perforemed and what role SVD plays here\n",
    "- Understand how LSA can be used to visualize similarities and/or differences in both documents and terms\n",

    "Creating a BoW representation of a corpus is fairly straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the number of unique words across all documents in the corpus\n",
    "2. Initialize a zero-vector for each document in the corpus, its length should be equal to the number of unique words across all documents\n",
    "3. For each document in the corpus, count the occurances of each unique word\n",
    "4. Set these number of occurances in that document, as the value for the corresponding word in the corresponding vector\n",
    "5. For $m$ documents and $n$ unique words, this should leave you with an $n \\times m$ matrix we can call $A$. the number $a_{i,j}$ will then be how many times the i'th word appears in the j'th document\n",
    "6. Optionally now, you can remove rows that correspond to stop words (this is often based on a known list of stop words)\n",
    "\n",
    "This can then be expanded to include **bigrams**, **trigrams**, and in general, **n-grams**. This is simply done by increasing the number of unique words to include all unique bigrams, trigrams, etc. The result in any case, should be something akin to what we see below (though transposed in our case).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Documents that share a lot of words, must be closely related in subject\n",
    "2. Words that appear in the same type of documents must be closely related in meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform LSA kinda like we do Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in this case, we use SVD. For the specific details of SVD, refer to the slides for week 7, page ~21.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes for implementation, we are interested in matrices in particular, which we get from our $n \\times m$ BoW matrix $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The term-by-term matrix, a $n \\times n$ matrix, gotten from $B = AA^T$. $b_{i,j}$ tells us how many documents word $i$ appears in, that word $j$ also appears in\n",
    "2. The document-by-document matrix, a $m \\times m$ matrix, gotten from $C =A^TA$. $c_{i,j}$ tells us how many words are shared by document $i$ and document $j$\n",

    "If we perform SVD on either of these matrices, we can get a lower-dimensional representation of how our documents or our words relate to one another. Letting us plot which words or documents relate to one another, very useful for large corpuses. Of course, there are a few limitations, among other things, we cannot say anything about words that do not appear in the corpus (outside our vocabulary). Nor can we say anything about the ordering of words, grammar, or the endings of words.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python does tons of things in ways no other programming language would dream of doing them. For that reason, it's good enough to familiarize yourself with at least some of the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, familiarize yourself with the commands and methods, play around with them as you like, but don't get stuck too long here.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **0.1 💻 Familiarize yourself with the following ways of manipulating strings in Python. Mess around with the results until you get a feel for what each one does.**\n",

    "Assume all variables are python strings (`<class 'str'>`) unless otherwise specified\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Concatenating two strings, `a` and `b` with `a + b`\n",
    "2. Repeating a string `a` n times with `a * n`\n",
    "3. Converting a string `a` to lower- or upper-case with `a.lower()` and `a.upper`, respectively\n",
    "4. Finding out whether a substring `c` is contained within a given string `a` with `c in a` (yields true or false)\n",
    "5. Splitting a string `a` based on a certain delimiter `d` with `a.split(d)` (default split value is on whitespace)\n",
    "6. Joining a list of strings `e`, while adding a given delimiter `f` between each element with `f.join(e)` \n",
    "7. Use f-strings to format with. Adding a string `b` to a given string `a` being created with the pattern of `a = f\"the value of b will be printed after the colon: {b}\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinda uniquely, Python also lets you treat strings as 'lists of characters', so you can index and slice strings as you would normally\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Index a string `a` to get the `n`'th (where n is an integer) letter with `a[n]`\n",
    "9. Get a substring from `a` from the `n`'th to the `m`'th letter (`n` and `m` being integers): `a[n:m]`\n",
    "10. Get the number of letters in a string `a` with `len(a)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Python supports [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). Essentially a supremely flexible way of matching strings or finding patterns in strings. Python does this through the `re` module, available by default in most Python compilers. re in Python uses '[patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)' to determine what is being matched on. These can be rather complicated, so our advice is, don't worry about learning them by heart. Look up specific usecases on stackexchange or make an LLM write them...\n",
    "\n",
    "11.  Search for the **first match** on a specific pattern `p` in a string `a` with `re.search(p, a)`\n",
    "12.  Return **all non-overlapping matches** for pattern `p` in a string `a` with `re.findall(p, a)`\n",
    "13.  Split a string `a` on a specific pattern `p`p with `re.split(p, a)` - like a more flexible version of `.split()`\n",
    "14.  Substitute a specific pattern `p` with a string `b`' in a string `a` with `re.sub(p, b, a)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are obviously tons more, but for something like string manipulation, it is often best to just look up solutions for a specific usecase when you need it.\n",

This naturally suggests that we use principal component analysis (PCA) to understand the structure of the documents by decomposing the matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ into eigenvectors and eigenvalues,\n",

    "where $\\mathbf{U}$ is a matrix of eigenvectors and $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.  Specifically, it is a basis matrix where each basis direction is a latent topic – you can think of each as a “theme” capturing a particular pattern of how terms co-occur across documents.\n",

    "*(Optional) Technical note: Formally, the term-by-term matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ is the second order moment of the documents and not the covariance matrix as typically used in principal component analysis. We could obtain the actual empirical covariance matrix from by substracting the outer product of the mean vectors, i.e. $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{m}\\mathbf{m}^T$, where $\\mathbf{m}$ is the mean document vector. However, we choose not to do this for computational reasons. Namely, the matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ is sparse, meaning that most of the entries are equal to zero. This has the benefit that we can represent it very efficiently in our computers. In contrast, the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ will in general not be sparse and hence, it is requires more memory to store the matrix. This does not make a big difference for the small example we consider here, but this can be prohibitive costly for real-world large-scale applications.  The same line of reasoning applies to the matrix $\\mathbf{C}$.*\n",
