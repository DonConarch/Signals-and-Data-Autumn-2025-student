    "# Week 8 - NLP, N-grams and FastText\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen in the lectures, NLP has a wide range of techniques and applications of such techniques. We will give you an introduction to some of these techniques, and today you will get hands-on experience with them. In today's exercise, we will look at the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we represent text in a vectorized way that encodes context? (One answer here is N-grams, and those we will look at).\n",
    "2. How do we create and sample from an N-gram language model - and how does the size of the grams affect the generated text?\n",
    "3. How do we use a pre-existing language model (FastText), to classify text messages as spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using later today is a dataset consisting of \"spam or ham\" text messages. The dataset consists of a number of text messages, some of which are spam and some of which are so-called \"ham\". We will use FastText to classify mails as spam or ham. For now, we will be looking at some different texts, to see how we can use N-grams to generate text, and how we can create N-gram language models from a text corpus.\n",

    "\n",
    "The question now is, how can we generate a text using this conditional probability. A way of doing this is to sample from a conditional probability distribution based on our obtained N-grams. In essence, we can give a seed to our conditional probability (also called a context), and then we need to generate a word from our conditional probability by sampling from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we will define a function that allows us to generate a sentence based on a provided conditional distribution. In the cell we create such a conditional distribution and generate 5 sentences using the same text seed. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use  following as help to implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable which will be the output string and assign the text_seed to it\n",
    "2. Split the text_seed into words and check its length, it should be N-1\n",
    "    - If the text seed is too short append the start character to it\n",
    "    - If the text seed is too long change it to the last N-1 words\n",
    "3. Create a variable that holds the current context (text_seed right now)\n",
    "4. Loop across the number of words we wish to generate\n",
    "   - If the current context is not in the `cond_prob` dictionary, return the generated sentence\n",
    "   - If it is, sample a target word from the context according to its probability distribution and update the context for the next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4.2. Answer the following questions about the text generation you have just implemented:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is it that even though we use the same text seed, the generated sentences changes?\n",
    "2. What happens as you increase the N-gram size as shown in the cell below? Does this makes sense - and if so, why?\n",
    "3. Is it more optimal to have smaller or larger N-gram size? Try to experiment with generated sentences as N goes from 2->7.\n",
