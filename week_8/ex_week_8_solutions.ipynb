    "# Week 8 - NLP, N-grams and FastText\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen in the lectures, NLP has a wide range of techniques and applications of such techniques. We will give you an introduction to some of these techniques, and today you will get hands-on experience with them. In today's exercise, we will look at the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we represent text in a vectorized way that encodes context? (One answer here is N-grams, and those we will look at).\n",
    "2. How do we create and sample from an N-gram language model - and how does the size of the grams affect the generated text?\n",
    "3. How do we use a pre-existing language model (FastText), to classify text messages as spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using later today is a dataset consisting of \"spam or ham\" text messages. The dataset consists of a number of text messages, some of which are spam and some of which are so-called \"ham\". We will use FastText to classify mails as spam or ham. For now, we will be looking at some different texts, to see how we can use N-grams to generate text, and how we can create N-gram language models from a text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this week, you should be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Know what N-grams mean\n",
    "- Know how word-wise and character-wise N-grams can be constructed\n",
    "- Know how to model next-word probabilities given a context\n",
    "- Know how to model next-n-gram probabilities given a context\n",
    "- Know roughly how Fasttext uses n-grams and character-grams\n",

    "## **N-grams and word probability models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall we want to use the N-grams for probabilistic word modelling tasks, for example, next word predictions given some sequence of words which we can express the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w_n|w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n-2}, w_{n-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The problem is that estimating such probabilities for very long sequences is computationally and memory-wise VERY expensive. So as a solution we sometimes use N-grams. In N-grams, the assumption is that we can model these conditional dependencies with shorter sequences of words, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "P(w_n|w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n-2}, w_{n-1}) & \\approx P(w_n) \\quad \\text{(Unigram)}\\\\\n",

    "P(w_n|w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n-2}, w_{n-1}) & \\approx P(w_n|w_{n-2}, w_{n-1}) \\quad \\text{(Trigram)}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we then compute as:\n",

    "P(w_n|w_{n-2}, w_{n-1}) = \\frac{\\text{Count}(w_{n-2}, w_{n-1}, w_n)}{\\text{Count}(w_{n-2}, w_{n-1})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The language model that we create is based on some text corpus from which we obtain the count measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fasttext (briefly):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fasttext is a model created by Meta (back when they were still facebook). Basically, it is a [CBoW or SkipGram model](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/unsupervised-tutorial.html#Advanced%20readers:%20skipgram%20versus%20cbow), which uses **both character and word n-grams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "CBoWs and Skipgrams are 'nothing special', they're quite ubiquitous, especially around the time of fasttext, what set it apart was a lot of clever software tricks, as well as its use of n-grams. This is arguably what you should focus on learning about it, if anything.\n",

    "The texts we will be experimenting with N-grams on are the two famous books Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen and The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin. The two books have been obtained in a raw text format from https://www.gutenberg.org/, i.e. Project Gutenberg which concerns itself with the collection of Open Access e-books.\n",

Preprocessing of these, can have a large impact on the eventual performance of language models, such as N-gram models. We have included the text-preprocessing steps in the cell below. In the output cell you will notice that the first chapter of pride and prejudice is printed out. It is then preprocessed using the `preprocess_text` function and printed out again.\n",

    "   -  *HINT: `\\n` is the character used for newlines*\n",

    "6. Join the document again, which was previously split by newlines\n",
    "7. Replace `\\n` with whitespace and double-whitespaces with single whitespaces\n",

      "Pride and prejudice preprocessed:  it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. my dear mr. bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last? mr. bennet replied that he had not. but it is returned she for mrs. long has just been here and she told me all about it. mr. bennet made no answer. do not you want to know who has taken it? cried his wife impatiently. you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it. this was invitation enough. why my dear you must know mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week. what is his name? bingley. is he married or single? oh! single my dear to be sure! a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls! how so? how can it affect them? my dear mr. bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them. is that his design in settling here? design! nonsense how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes. i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr. bingley might like you the best of the party. my dear you flatter me. i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty. in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of. but my dear you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood. it is more than i engage for i assure you. but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers. indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not. you are over scrupulous surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy. i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydia. but you are always giving her the preference. they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. mr. bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take delight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves. you mistake me my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least. ah you do not know what i suffer. but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood. it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them. depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all. mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. her mind was less difficult to develop. she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper. when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news.   mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr. bingley will like it lizzy. we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit. but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him. i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two nieces of her own. she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her. no more have i said mr. bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you. mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters. dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake! have a little compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces. kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill. i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully. when is your next ball to be lizzy? tomorrow fortnight. aye so it is cried her mother and mrs. long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself. then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr. bingley to her. impossible mr. bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing? i honour your circumspection. a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little. one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself. the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only nonsense nonsense! what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation? cried he. do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you there. what say you mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts. mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how. while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr. bingley. i am sick of mr. bingley cried his wife. i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before? if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him. it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now. the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. how good it was in you my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. well how pleased i am! and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now. now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr. bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife. what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut. i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter. at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do anything. lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball. oh! said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallest. the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner.   not all that mrs. bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley. they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had been delighted with him. he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr. bingleys heart were entertained. if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs. bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for. in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father. the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all. mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc. mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted. she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin. and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr. bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man. mr. bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion. his brotherinlaw mr. hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year. the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. what a contrast between him and his friend! mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party. his character was decided. he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr. bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it. come darcy said he i must have you dance. i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better dance. i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with. i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom! upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty. you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr. darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet. oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you. which do you mean? and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me. mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous. the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way. elizabeth felt janes pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear. oh my dear mr. bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball. i wish you had been there. jane was so admired nothing could be like it. everybody said how well she looked and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice. only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. first of all he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance. so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next. then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much! for gods sake say no more of his partners. oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance! oh! my dear continued mrs. bennet i am quite delighted with him. he is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the lace upon mrs. hursts gown here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy. but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns. i quite detest the man.   when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible goodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy manners!so much ease with such perfect good breeding! he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can. his character is thereby complete. i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. i did not expect such a compliment. did not you? i did for you. but that is one great difference between us. compliments always take you by surprise and me never. what could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a stupider person. dear lizzy! oh! you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general. you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life. i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think. i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder. with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone. and so you like this mans sisters too do you? their manners are not equal to his. certainly not at first. but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her. elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them. they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited. they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others. they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase. his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs. hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house. he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately. between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion. in understanding darcy was the superior. bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever. he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence. the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much. mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.   within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st. jamess had made him courteous. lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend. that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate. you began the evening well charlotte said mrs. bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas. you were mr. bingleys first choice. yes but he seemed to like his second better. oh! you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice. to be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr. robinson. perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson did not i mention it to you? mr. robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last questionoh! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point. upon my word! well that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know. my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte. mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he?poor eliza!to be only just tolerable. i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips. are you quite sure maam?is not there a little mistake? said jane. i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her. ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to. miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. with them he is remarkably agreeable. i do not believe a word of it my dear. if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise. i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza. another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you. i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him. his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself. if i may so express it he has a right to be proud. that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine. pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe. by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously. a person may be proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us. if i were as rich as mr. darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day. then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs. bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly. the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit.   the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit was returned in due form. miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs. hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration. it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas. it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on. but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow. if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too. remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do. but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out. perhaps he must if he sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention. when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses. your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it. but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design. as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. she has known him only a fortnight. she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite enough to make her understand his character. not as you represent it. had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal. yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded. well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life. you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound. you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself. occupied in observing mr. bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise. but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness. of this she was perfectly unawareto her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others. his doing so drew her notice. it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled. what does mr. darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster? that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer. but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about. he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him. on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr. darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton? with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic. you are severe on us. it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas. i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows. you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers. on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must. and gravely glancing at mr. darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridgeand i shall keep mine to swell my song. her performance was pleasing though by no means capital. after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display. mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began. what a charming amusement for young people this is mr. darcy! there is nothing like dancing after all. i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies. certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.every savage can dance. sir william only smiled. your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr. darcy. you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir. yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. do you often dance at st. jamess? never sir. do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place? it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it. you have a house in town i conclude? mr. darcy bowed. i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas. he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing? mr. darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you. and taking her hand he would have given it to mr. darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner. mr. darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain. elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one halfhour. mr. darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling. he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner? elizabeth looked archly and turned away. her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie. i should imagine not. you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion. i was never more annoyed! the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them! your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you. my mind was more agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow. miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. mr. darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet. miss elizabeth bennet! repeated miss bingley. i am all astonishment. how long has she been such a favourite?and pray when am i to wish you joy? that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment. i knew you would be wishing me joy. nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you. he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long.   mr. bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds. she had a sister married to a mr. phillips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade. the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarters. their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections. their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr. philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers and mr. bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr. bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced. catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london. i am astonished my dear said mrs. bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own however. if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it. yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever. this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree. i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish. my dear mr. bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals. mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library. mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer. mrs. bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love. it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud. my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days ttette between two women can never end without a quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.yours ever caroline bingley with the officers! cried lydia. i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that. dining out said mrs. bennet that is very unlucky. can i have the carriage? said jane. no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night. that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home. oh! but the gentlemen will have mr. bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs. i had much rather go in the coach. but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure. they are wanted in the farm mr. bennet are not they? they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them. but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered. she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted. the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back. this was a lucky idea of mine indeed! said mrs. bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better. they insist also on my seeing mr. jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with me.yours c. well my dear said mr. bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley and under your orders. oh! i am not at all afraid of her dying. people do not die of little trifling colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays there it is all very well. i would go and see her if i could have the carriage. elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative. she declared her resolution. how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there. i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want. is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses? no indeed. i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles. i shall be back by dinner. i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required. we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia. elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together. if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes. in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise. she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness. mr. darcy said very little and mr. hurst nothing at all. the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone. the latter was thinking only of his breakfast. her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance. she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. elizabeth silently attended her. when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane. the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts. the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely. elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere. when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so. miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present. elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.   at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner. to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer. jane was by no means better. the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike. their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. she had very little notice from any but him. miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr. hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her. when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty. mrs. hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker. i shall never forget her appearance this morning. she really looked almost wild. she did indeed louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance. very nonsensical to come at all! why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold? her hair so untidy so blowsy! yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office. your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice. you observed it mr. darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition. certainly not. to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone! what could she mean by it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorum. it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley. i am afraid mr. darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes. not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise. a short pause followed this speech and mrs. hurst began again. i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it. i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton. yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside. that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily. if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable. but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy. to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations. with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee. she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment. do you prefer reading to cards? said he that is rather singular. miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards. she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else. i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things. in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well. elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded. and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into. elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room. i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books. what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr. darcy! it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations. and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books. i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these. neglect! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley. i wish it may. but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model. there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire. with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it. i am talking of possibilities charles. upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation. elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game. is miss darcy much grown since the spring? said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am? i think she will. she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller. how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much. such a countenance such manners!and so extremely accomplished for her age! her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite. it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are. all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles what do you mean? yes all of them i think. they all paint tables cover screens and net purses. i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished. your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth. the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished. nor i i am sure said miss bingley. then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman. yes i do comprehend a great deal in it. oh! certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved. all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading. i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. i rather wonder now at your knowing any. are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this? i never saw such a woman. i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united. mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr. hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds. but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art. undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable. miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her. bingley urged mr. joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better. bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable. they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.   elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation. the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast. had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs. bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable. after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected. indeed i have sir was her answer. she is a great deal too ill to be moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass a little longer on your kindness. removed! cried bingley. it must not be thought of. my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal. you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us. mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. you have a sweet room here mr. bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease. whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes. at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here. that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth. you begin to comprehend me do you? cried he turning towards her. oh! yesi understand you perfectly. i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful. that is as it happens. it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours. lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home. i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character. it must be an amusing study. yes but intricate characters are the most amusing. they have at least that advantage. the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society. but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever. yes indeed cried mrs. bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town. everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away. mrs. bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph. i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places. the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr. bingley? when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same. they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either. ayethat is because you have the right disposition. but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all. indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother. you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true. certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with fourandtwenty families. nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance. his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile. elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away. yes she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sir william is mr. bingleyis not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! he has always something to say to everybody. that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter. did charlotte dine with you? no she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies. for my part mr. bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently. but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you. it is a pity they are not handsome! not that i think charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend. she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley. oh! dear yes but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty. i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybody better looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my own partiality. when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. but however he did not. perhaps he thought her too young. however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were. and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently. there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way. i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love! i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy. of a fine stout healthy love it may. everything nourishes what is strong already. but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away. darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required. she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs. bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield. lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance. she was very equal therefore to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear. i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball. but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill. lydia declared herself satisfied. oh! yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again. and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not. mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes.   the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom. the loo table however did not appear. mr. darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet and mrs. hurst was observing their game. elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter! he made no answer. you write uncommonly fast. you are mistaken. i write rather slowly. how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! letters of business too! how odious i should think them! it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours. pray tell your sister that i long to see her. i have already told her so once by your desire. i am afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you. i mend pens remarkably well. thank youbut i always mend my own. how can you contrive to write so even? he was silent. tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys. will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice. oh! it is of no consequence. i shall see her in january. but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr. darcy? they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine. it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill. that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease. he studies too much for words of four syllables. do not you darcy? my style of writing is very different from yours. oh! cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. he leaves out half his words and blots the rest. my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents. your humility mr. bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof. nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility. it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast. and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty? the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs. bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else? nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment. at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies. i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month. you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now much more than he did himself. i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could. would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it? upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself. you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety. to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you. to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either. you appear to me mr. darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it? will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties? by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of. i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do. mr. darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. i see your design bingley said his friend. you dislike an argument and want to silence this. perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me. what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter. mr. darcy took her advice and did finish his letter. when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself. mrs. hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr. darcys eyes were fixed on her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she liked him too little to care for his approbation. after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr. darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel? she smiled but made no answer. he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence. oh! said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply. you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare. indeed i do not dare. elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger. miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth. she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance. i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses. have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity? oh! yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great uncle the judge. they are in the same profession you know only in different lines. as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes? it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied. at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself. i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard. you used us abominably ill answered mrs. hurst running away without telling us that you were coming out. then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into the avenue. but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. goodbye. she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.   when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. their powers of conversation were considerable. they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. he addressed himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr. hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation. he was full of joy and attention. the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the door. he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else. elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight. when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr. hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs. hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet. miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some enquiry or looking at his page. she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on. at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library. no one made any reply. she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield? i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure. if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards. i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day. much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball. miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious. in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude. elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately. miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr. darcy looked up. he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book. he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning?and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it. miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak. you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire. oh! shocking! cried miss bingley. i never heard anything so abominable. how shall we punish him for such a speech? nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth. we can all plague and punish one another. tease himlaugh at him. intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done. but upon my honour i do not. i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! no no i feel he may defy us there. and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject. mr. darcy may hug himself. mr. darcy is not to be laughed at! cried elizabeth. that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. i dearly love a laugh. miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be. the wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of their actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke. certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am not one of them. i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good. follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can. but these i suppose are precisely what you are without. perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule. such as vanity and pride. yes vanity is a weakness indeed. but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation. elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. your examination of mr. darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result? i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect. he owns it himself without disguise. no said darcy i have made no such pretension. i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch for. it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself. my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lost forever. that is a failing indeed! cried elizabeth. implacable resentment is a shade in a character. but you have chosen your fault well. i really cannot laugh at it. you are safe from me. there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evila natural defect which not even the best education can overcome. and your defect is to hate everybody. and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstand them. do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share. louisa you will not mind my waking mr. hurst? her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it. he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.   in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home. mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well. against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr. bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made. the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough. she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself. he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her. on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place. miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits. they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle. the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth. they found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and human nature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort. much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.   i hope my dear said mr. bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party. who do you mean my dear? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinners are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home. the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger. mrs. bennets eyes sparkled. a gentleman and a stranger! it is mr. bingley i am sure! well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley. butgood lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got today. lydia my love ring the belli must speak to hill this moment. it is not mr. bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life. this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once. after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention. it is from my cousin mr. collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases. oh! my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned. pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it. jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. they had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about. it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr. bennet and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn. but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself. no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical. i hate such false friends. why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did before him? why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear. hunsford near westerham kent 15th october. dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.there mrs. bennet.my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england. as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut of this hereafter. if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr. bennet as he folded up the letter. he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again. there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him. though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit. elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required. he must be an oddity i think said she. i cannot make him out.there is something very pompous in his style.and what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?we cannot suppose he would help it if he could.could he be a sensible man sir? no my dear i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well. i am impatient to see him. in point of composition said mary the letter does not seem defective. the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed. to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. as for their mother mr. collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters. mr. collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself. he was a tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty. his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal. he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs. bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily. you are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so oddly. you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate. ah! sir i do indeed. it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess. not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world. there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed. i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other. they were not the only objects of mr. collinss admiration. the hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. but he was set right there by mrs. bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. he begged pardon for having displeased her. in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.   during dinner mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen better. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her. she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs. that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs. bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman. it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. does she live near you sir? the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyships residence. i think you said she was a widow sir? has she any family? she has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property. ah! said mrs. bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls. and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome? she is a most charming young lady indeed. lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them. but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies. has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court. her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament. her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay. you judge very properly said mr. bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study? they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible. mr. bennets expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure. by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. mr. collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels. kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed. other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons. lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him. my aunt told me so herself on saturday. i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town. lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr. collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit. it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. but i will no longer importune my young cousin. then turning to mr. bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. mr. bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. mrs. bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr. collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr. bennet and prepared for backgammon.   mr. collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance. the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility. having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. his plan did not vary on seeing them. miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice. the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours ttette with mrs. bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on. as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged. mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire. elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course. mrs. bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces. lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr. collins was to attend them at the request of mr. bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr. collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr. bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford. such doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly. in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr. collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go. in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton. the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them. but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the way. the officer was the very mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to enquire and he bowed as they passed. all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot. mr. denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr. wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address. the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street. on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities. bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object. he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. both changed colour one looked white the other red. mr. wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return. what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know. in another minute mr. bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend. mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr. phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of mrs. phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation. mrs. phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr. joness shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr. collins by janes introduction of him. she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. mrs. phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and enquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr. denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire. she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr. wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows. some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr. wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening. this was agreed to and mrs. phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits. mr. collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless. as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. phillipss manners and politeness. he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before. something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.   as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr. collinss scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr. wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house. when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs. phillips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room. in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs. phillips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared very long. it was over at last however. the gentlemen did approach and when mr. wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillips breathing port wine who followed them into the room. mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. when the cardtables were placed he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist. i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation in life mrs. phillips was very glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason. mr. wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. allowing for the common demands of the game mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldthe history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared not even mention that gentleman. her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. he enquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there. about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand. yes replied mr. wickham his estate there is a noble one. a clear ten thousand per annum. you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy. elizabeth could not but look surprised. you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcy? as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly. i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable. i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. it is impossible for me to be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. here you are in your own family. upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield. he is not at all liked in hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone. i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen. the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen. i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man. wickham only shook his head. i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer. i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood. oh! noit is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy. if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go. we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he is. his father miss bennet the late mr. darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father. elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further enquiry. mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire. i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them. society i own is necessary to me. i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude. i must have employment and society. a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible. the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now. indeed! yesthe late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. he was my godfather and excessively attached to me. i cannot do justice to his kindness. he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere. good heavens! cried elizabeth but how could that be? how could his will be disregarded? why did you not seek legal redress? there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr. darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudencein short anything or nothing. certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. i have a warm unguarded temper and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely. i can recall nothing worse. but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me. this is quite shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced. some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me. till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him. elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. but what said she after a pause can have been his motive? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly? a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life. he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me. i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him. i had not thought so very ill of him. i had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this. after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper. his disposition must be dreadful. i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him. elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father! she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner! we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care. my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr. phillips appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr. darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy a most intimate confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and when immediately before my fathers death mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself. how strange! cried elizabeth. how abominable! i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you! if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it. it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend. it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride. can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good? yes. it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor. family pride and filial pridefor he is very proud of what his father washave done this. not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive. he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers. what sort of girl is miss darcy? he shook his head. i wish i could call her amiable. it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy. but she is too much like her brothervery very proud. as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she is nothing to me now. she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished. since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education. after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley! how can mr. bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you know mr. bingley? not at all. he is a sweettempered amiable charming man. he cannot know what mr. darcy is. probably not but mr. darcy can please where he chooses. he does not want abilities. he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure. the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. phillips. the usual enquiries as to his success were made by the latter. it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs. phillips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasy. i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters. mr. wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr. collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh. lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long. you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy. no indeed i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections. i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday. her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates. this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined for another. mr. collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman. i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class. elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickhams attentions. there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him to everybody. whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr. collins in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.   elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr. wickham and herself. jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. the possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained. they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea. interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side. very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody. laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for. it is impossible. no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it. can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no. i can much more easily believe mr. bingleys being imposed on than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony. if it be not so let mr. darcy contradict it. besides there was truth in his looks. it is difficult indeedit is distressing. one does not know what to think. i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think. but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr. bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public. the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday. the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others. they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennets civilities. the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card. jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcys look and behaviour. the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball. and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it. while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody. elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance. i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her. elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. she had fully proposed being engaged by mr. wickham for those very dances and to have mr. collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. there was no help for it however. mr. wickhams happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer and mr. collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors. the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her. elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. mr. collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him. if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once. no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy. even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia.   till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here. this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham. she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley whose blind partiality provoked her. but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice. the first two dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification. mr. collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. the moment of her release from him was ecstasy. she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked. when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him. he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable. heaven forbid! that would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! do not wish me such an evil. when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it. they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance. he replied and was again silent. after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time withit is your turn to say something now mr. darcy. i talked about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples. he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said. very well. that reply will do for the present. perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. but now we may be silent. do you talk by rule then while you are dancing? sometimes. one must speak a little you know. it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible. are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine? both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the clat of a proverb. this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he. how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say. you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly. i must not decide on my own performance. he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton. she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance. the effect was immediate. a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on. at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain. he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life. darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject. at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner. i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir. such very superior dancing is not often seen. it is evident that you belong to the first circles. allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place. what congratulations will then flow in! i appeal to mr. darcybut let me not interrupt you sir. you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me. the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together. recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of. i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine. what think you of books? said he smiling. booksoh! no. i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings. i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject. we may compare our different opinions. noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else. the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it? said he with a look of doubt. yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr. darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable. you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created? i am said he with a firm voice. and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice? i hope not. it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first. may i ask to what these questions tend? merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity. i am trying to make it out. and what is your success? she shook her head. i do not get on at all. i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly. i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either. but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity. i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied. she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another. they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham! your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late mr. darcys steward. let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr. darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it. i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better. his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself. i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer. excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant. insolent girl! said elizabeth to herself. you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr. darcy. she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness. i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon. no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man. i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr. darcys regard. mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself? no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton. this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy. i am satisfied. but what does he say of the living? he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only. i have not a doubt of mr. bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr. bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before. she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr. bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology. you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy! indeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. i believe him to be lady catherines nephew. it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight. elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr. darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty. pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself. and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh. it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr. darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way. mr. collins then returned to elizabeth. i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. it was really a very handsome thought. upon the whole i am much pleased with him. as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters. her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much. when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr. bingley. it was an animating subject and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy who sat opposite to them. her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. what is mr. darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear. for heavens sake madam speak lower. what advantage can it be for you to offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing! nothing that she could say however had any influence. her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song. elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another. marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies. she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley. she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however imperturbably grave. she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night. he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child. you have delighted us long enough. let the other young ladies have time to exhibit. mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good. others of the party were now applied to. if i said mr. collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to. the rector of a parish has much to do. in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family. and with a bow to mr. darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. many staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man. to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable. the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased by mr. collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. there was no arguing upon such a project. she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr. collinss conversation to herself. she was at least free from the offense of mr. darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham and rejoiced in it. the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy said nothing at all. mr. bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene. mr. bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am! accompanied by a violent yawn. when at length they arose to take leave mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself especially to mr. bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation. bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure. elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield.   the next day opened a new scene at longbourn. mr. collins made his declaration in form. having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. on finding mrs. bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning? before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs. bennet answered instantly oh dear!yescertainly. i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection. come kitty i want you up stairs. and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear madam do not go. i beg you will not go. mr. collins must excuse me. he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. i am going away myself. no no nonsense lizzy. i desire you to stay where you are. and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr. collins. elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. mrs. bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began. believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections. you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address. you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life. but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did. the idea of mr. collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness. twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too! on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr. collins you must marry. a clergyman like you must marry. choose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way. this is my advice. find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her. allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i can assure you there are many amiable young women. but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years. this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to. on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married. it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. you are too hasty sir she cried. you forget that i have made no answer. let me do it without further loss of time. accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them. i am not now to learn replied mr. collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long. upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. i am perfectly serious in my refusal. you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so. nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation. were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr. collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. and you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualification. indeed mr. collins all praise of me will be unnecessary. you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say. i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach. this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled. and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr. collins not thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character. really mr. collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly. if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one. you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable. my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females. i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible. my feelings in every respect forbid it. can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart. you are uniformly charming! cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable. to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.   mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs. bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. this information however startled mrs. bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so. but depend upon it mr. collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason. i will speak to her about it directly. she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it. pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr. collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity. sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs. bennet alarmed. lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. in everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived. i will go directly to mr. bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure. she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh! mr. bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar. you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her. mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication. i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech. of what are you talking? of mr. collins and lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy. and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems an hopeless business. speak to lizzy about it yourself. tell her that you insist upon her marrying him. let her be called down. she shall hear my opinion. mrs. bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library. come here child cried her father as she appeared. i have sent for you on an affair of importance. i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage. is it true? elizabeth replied that it was. very welland this offer of marriage you have refused? i have sir. very well. we now come to the point. your mother insists upon your accepting it. is it not so mrs. bennet? yes or i will never see her again. an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth. from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins and i will never see you again if you do. elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs. bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed. what do you mean mr. bennet in talking this way? you promised me to insist upon her marrying him. my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request. first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room. i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be. not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs. bennet give up the point. she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns. she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. though her manner varied however her determination never did. mr. collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed. he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way. his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret. while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them. she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him. charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs. bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me. i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves. charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth. aye there she comes continued mrs. bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way. but i tell you miss lizzyif you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you. i have done with you from this very day. i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word. i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody. people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. nobody can tell what i suffer! but it is always so. those who do not complain are never pitied. her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins who entered the room with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let me and mr. collins have a little conversation together. elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr. collins whose enquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. in a doleful voice mrs. bennet began the projected conversation oh! mr. collins! my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point. far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter. resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned. perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own. but we are all liable to error. i have certainly meant well through the whole affair. my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise.   the discussion of mr. collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend. the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennets illhumour or ill health. mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride. elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he meant to stay. after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to enquire if mr. wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball. he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked over. to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed. i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr. darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself. she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her. his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield. the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs. when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal. the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming back again. you shall hear what she says. she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr. hurst had a house. the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. i depend on you for that. to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his. it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them. caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that i despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you. it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter. it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should. why will you think so? it must be his own doing. he is his own master. but you do not know all. i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from you. mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart. with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many? what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy? said jane as she finished it. is it not clear enough? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly! to put me on my guard? can there be any other opinion on the subject? yes there can for mine is totally different. will you hear it? most willingly. you shall have it in a few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you. jane shook her head. indeed jane you ought to believe me. no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. miss bingley i am sure cannot. she is not such a simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way. but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend. if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy. but i know the foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself. that is right. you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine. believe her to be deceived by all means. you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer. but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere? you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him. how can you talk so? said jane faintly smiling. you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate. i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion. but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required. a thousand things may arise in six months! the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone. she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses.   the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins. elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express. charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr. collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself. such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon. but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet. he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. his reception however was of the most flattering kind. miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. in as short a time as mr. collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained. sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. mr. collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. jamess. the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid. charlotte herself was tolerably composed. she had gained her point and had time to consider of it. her reflections were in general satisfactory. mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary. but still he would be her husband. without thinking highly either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want. this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them. my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible. they were all astonished and mr. bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness. my dear sir replied mr. collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence. you cannot be too much upon your guard. risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence. believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth. with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before. the possibility of mr. collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr. collins! my dear charlotteimpossible! the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza? do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you? but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. i see what you are feeling replied charlotte. you must be surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you. but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic you know i never was. i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr. collinss character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state. elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. the strangeness of mr. collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. charlotte the wife of mr. collins was a most humiliating picture! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.   elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs. bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord! sir william how can you tell such a story? do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy? nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr. collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london. mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off. two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing could console and nothing could appease her. nor did that day wear out her resentment. a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. mr. bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr. collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton. lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs. bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return. jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted. after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. mr. collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingleys continued absence. neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently occurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment. as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to. but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. mr. collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed. mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state. the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. the sight of miss lucas was odious to her. as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr. bennet were dead. she complained bitterly of all this to her husband. indeed mr. bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take her place in it! my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for better things. let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor. this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before. i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. if it was not for the entail i should not mind it. what should not you mind? i should not mind anything at all. let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility. i never can be thankful mr. bennet for anything about the entail. how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr. collins too! why should he have it more than anybody else? i leave it to yourself to determine said mr. bennet.   miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt. the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country. hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort. miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it. her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr. darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture. elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation. her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others. to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit. that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself. it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing. she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded. a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs. bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. but i will not repine. it cannot last long. he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before. elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing. you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason. he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all. i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with. thank god! i have not that pain. a little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better. with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself. my dear jane! exclaimed elizabeth you are too good. your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you. i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve. miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection. nay said elizabeth this is not fair. you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody. i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it. do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill. you need not. there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well. the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage. it is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable! my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these. they will ruin your happiness. you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. consider mr. collinss respectability and charlottes steady prudent character. remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin. to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart. my dear jane mr. collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas. you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness. i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. but enough of this. you alluded to something else. you mentioned two instances. i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk. we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. women fancy admiration means more than it does. and men take care that they should. if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine. i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery. thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business. and do you impute it to either of those? yes to the last. but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem. stop me whilst you can. you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him? yes in conjunction with his friend. i cannot believe it. why should they try to influence him? they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it. your first position is false. they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride. beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better. but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers. what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable? if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed. by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy. do not distress me by the idea. i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood. elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr. bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day. mrs. bennets best comfort was that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer. mr. bennet treated the matter differently. so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find. i congratulate her. next to being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. when is your turn to come? you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane. now is your time. here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. let wickham be your man. he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably. thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. we must not all expect janes good fortune. true said mr. bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it. mr. wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family. they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr. darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they had known anything of the matter. miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.   after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday. the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks. on the following monday mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn. mr. gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education. the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so wellbred and agreeable. mrs. gardiner who was several years younger than mrs. bennet and mrs. phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces. between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard. they had frequently been staying with her in town. the first part of mrs. gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. when this was done she had a less active part to play. it became her turn to listen. mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of. they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister. two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it. i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr. bingley if she could. but lizzy! oh sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been mr. collinss wife by this time had it not been for her own perverseness. he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him. the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. the lucases are very artful people indeed sister. they are all for what they can get. i am sorry to say it of them but so it is. it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves. mrs. gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation. when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject. it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she. i am sorry it went off. but these things happen so often! a young man such as you describe mr. bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent. an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us. we do not suffer by accident. it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before. but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea. it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment. pray how violent was mr. bingleys love? i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her. every time they met it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there be finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love? oh yes!of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poor jane! i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately. it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything. elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence. i hope added mrs. gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her. and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london! my dear aunt how could you think of it? mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr. bingley never stirs without him. so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane correspond with his sister? she will not be able to help calling. she will drop the acquaintance entirely. but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions. miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him. the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of itof which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs. gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation narrowly observed them both. without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. to mrs. gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers. about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged. they had therefore many acquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring. mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well. here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself. on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcys treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy.   mrs. gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly. seriously i would have you be on your guard. do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better. but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you. you have sense and we all expect you to use it. your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure. you must not disappoint your father. my dear aunt this is being serious indeed. yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise. well then you need not be under any alarm. i will take care of myself and of mr. wickham too. he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it. elizabeth you are not serious now. i beg your pardon i will try again. at present i am not in love with mr. wickham no i certainly am not. but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not. i see the imprudence of it. oh! that abominable mr. darcy! my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it. my father however is partial to mr. wickham. in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry. i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. when i am in company with him i will not be wishing. in short i will do my best. perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him. as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that. but do not imagine that he is always here so often. it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hope you are satisfied. her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented. mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet. his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy. thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room. as they went downstairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza. that you certainly shall. and i have another favour to ask you. will you come and see me? we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire. i am not likely to leave kent for some time. promise me therefore to come to hunsford. elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party. indeed eliza you will be as welcome as either of them. the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was. charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging. it was mr. collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys. her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline. she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost. my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street. she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley. i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london. i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her. i enquired after their brother of course. he was well but so much engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner. i wish i could see her. my visit was not long as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out. i dare say i shall see them soon here. elizabeth shook her head over this letter. it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sisters being in town. four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him. she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention. after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer. the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt. my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me. but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again. caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime. when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. i pity though i cannot help blaming her. she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago. he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy. i cannot understand it. if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happyyour affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. let me hear from you very soon. miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty. we had better not mention it. i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford. pray go to see them with sir william and maria. i am sure you will be very comfortable there.yours etc. this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least. all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr. darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else. elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain. her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it. the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy. all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil. but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king. i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. there can be no love in all this. my watchfulness has been effectual and though i certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance. importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do. they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.   with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away. march was to take elizabeth to hunsford. she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr. collins. there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay. everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch. she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter. the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be. the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter. the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more. his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing. her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. sir william lucas and his daughter maria a goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long. he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information. it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon. as they drove to mr. gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower. all was joy and kindness. the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres. elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. their first object was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection. it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long. mrs. gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance. mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well. but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary. pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary. if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think. she is a very good kind of girl i believe. i know no harm of her. but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune. nowhy should he? if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor? but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event. a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. if she does not object to it why should we? her not objecting does not justify him. it only shows her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling. well cried elizabeth have it as you choose. he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish. no lizzy that is what i do not choose. i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire. oh! if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better. i am sick of them all. thank heaven! i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all. take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment. before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer. we have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs. gardiner but perhaps to the lakes. no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. oh my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight! what felicity! you give me fresh life and vigour. adieu to disappointment and spleen. what are young men to rocks and mountains? oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. we will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen. lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.   every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight. when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view. the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side. elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants. at length the parsonage was discernible. the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving. mr. collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other. mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment. elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. when mr. collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte. once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear. after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. but of all the views which his garden or which the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground. from his garden mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help. it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. when mr. collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country. it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr. collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her. she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming. we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home. her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us. i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several. lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour. very true my dear that is exactly what i say. she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference. the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings. a lively imagination soon settled it all. about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her. she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is. make haste and come down this moment. elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate. and is this all? cried elizabeth. i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter. la! my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine. the old lady is mrs. jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh. only look at her. she is quite a little creature. who would have thought that she could be so thin and small? she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind. why does she not come in? oh charlotte says she hardly ever does. it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in. i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas. she looks sickly and cross. yes she will do for him very well. she will make him a very proper wife. mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way. at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house. mr. collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day.   mr. collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete. the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough. i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings. i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival! i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon. scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them. when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel. lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved. while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st. jamess. as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm. elizabeths courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation. from the entrancehall of which mr. collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary. in spite of having been at st. jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome. her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented. when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs. jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs. collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr. collins i think. for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family. do you play and sing miss bennet? a little. oh! thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you. our instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it some day. do your sisters play and sing? one of them does. why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned. the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours. do you draw? no not at all. what none of you? not one. that is very strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters. my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london. has your governess left you? we never had any governess. no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home without a governess! i never heard of such a thing. your mother must have been quite a slave to your education. elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case. then who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess you must have been neglected. compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be idle certainly might. aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it. it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way. i am always glad to get a young person well placed out. four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her. mrs. collins did i tell you of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure. lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure. are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet? yes maam all. all! what all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second. the younger ones out before the elder ones are married! your younger sisters must be very young? yes my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps she is full young to be much in company. but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. and to be kept back on such a motive! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind. upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. pray what is your age? with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it. lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age. i am not oneandtwenty. when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtables were placed. lady catherine sir william and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light. a great deal more passed at the other table. lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many. sir william did not say much. he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs. collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed. as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was. but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr. collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands.   sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. while sir william was with them mr. collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroom which fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards. elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement. from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out. very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collinss joints of meat were too large for her family. elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty. the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. their other engagements were few as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr. collinss reach. this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity. in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important. elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself. his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence. on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr. collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility. mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me. elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs. collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word. colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody. at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you never happened to see her there? she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.   colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings. it was some days however before they received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. for the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughter. colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr. darcy they had seen only at church. the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom. her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room. colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs. collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr. darcy. his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking of? what are you telling miss bennet? let me hear what it is. we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply. of music! then pray speak aloud. it is of all subjects my delight. i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste. if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient. and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply. i am confident that she would have performed delightfully. how does georgiana get on darcy? mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency. i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal. i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice. she practises very constantly. so much the better. it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs. collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs. jenkinsons room. she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house. mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and made no answer. when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument. he drew a chair near her. lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance. elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr. darcy by coming in all this state to hear me? i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me. i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own. elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say. i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. indeed mr. darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear. i am not afraid of you said he smilingly. pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam. i should like to know how he behaves among strangers. you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful. the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did? he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. mr. darcy you cannot deny the fact. i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party. true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom. well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next? my fingers wait your orders. perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers. shall we ask your cousin the reason of this? said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam. shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers? i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him. it is because he will not give himself the trouble. i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done. my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do. they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression. but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take the trouble of practising. it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution. darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right. you have employed your time much better. no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. we neither of us perform to strangers. here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of. elizabeth immediately began playing again. lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master. she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes. anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn. elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation. lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home.   elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor. as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr. darcy and mr. darcy only entered the room. he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within. they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr. darcy! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before. he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london? perfectly so i thank you. she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again? i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. he has many friends and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing. if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there. but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle. i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers. elizabeth made no answer. she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house. lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford. i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object. mr. collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife. yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had. my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did. she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her. it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends. an easy distance do you call it? it is nearly fifty miles. and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a days journey. yes i call it a very easy distance. i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth. i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family. it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire. anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far. as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances. where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil. but that is not the case here. mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance. mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. you cannot have been always at longbourn. elizabeth looked surprised. the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent? a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from her walk. the ttette surprised them. mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away. what can be the meaning of this? said charlotte as soon as he was gone. my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way. but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year. all field sports were over. within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannot always be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt. it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind. but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand. it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself. he seldom appeared really animated. mrs. collins knew not what to make of him. colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it out. she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success. he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable. it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power. in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam. he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all.   more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr. darcy. she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd! yet it did and even a third. it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too. his words seemed to imply it. could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage. she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her. putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way. i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage. are you going much farther? no i should have turned in a moment. and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together. do you certainly leave kent on saturday? said she. yesif darcy does not put it off again. but i am at his disposal. he arranges the business just as he pleases. and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy. he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam. but so we all do. it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor. i speak feelingly. a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence. in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for? these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature. but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from want of money. younger sons cannot marry where they like. unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do. our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money. is this thought elizabeth meant for me? and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son? unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds. he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped. to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her. no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me. i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy. are you indeed? and pray what sort of guardians do you make? does your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way. as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. she directly replied you need not be frightened. i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs. hurst and miss bingley. i think i have heard you say that you know them. i know them a little. their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcys. oh! yes said elizabeth drily mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him. care of him! yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him. but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant. it was all conjecture. what is it you mean? it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing. you may depend upon my not mentioning it. and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley. what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer. did mr. darcy give you reasons for this interference? i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady. and what arts did he use to separate them? he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling. he only told me what i have now told you. elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation. after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful. i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she. your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings. why was he to be the judge? you are rather disposed to call his interference officious? i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him. it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case. that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly. this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage. there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence. that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer. he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london. to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is!her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating. neither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities mr. darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach. when she thought of her mother her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister. the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea. mrs. collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home.   when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent. they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering. but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded. elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. mr. darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings. it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the nextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do. she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him. while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her. but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr. darcy walk into the room. in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. she answered him with cold civility. he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room. elizabeth was surprised but said not a word. after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you. elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression. she stared coloured doubted and was silent. this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed. he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. his sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit. in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger. she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done. he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security. such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned. it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you. but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration. the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation. mr. darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful. at length with a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected. but it is of small importance. i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character? was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil? but i have other provocations. you know i have. had not my feelings decided against youhad they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister? as she pronounced these words mr. darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued i have every reason in the world to think ill of you. no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind. she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity. can you deny that you have done it? she repeated. with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success. towards him i have been kinder than towards myself. elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her. but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded. long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham. on this subject what can you have to say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others? you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour. who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him? his misfortunes! repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed. and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy. you have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty. you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. you have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule. and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me! i thank you for explaining it so fully. my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed! but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything. but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related. they were natural and just. could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own? elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr. darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner. she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it. again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. she went on from the very beginningfrom the first moment i may almost sayof my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry. you have said quite enough madam. i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness. and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house. the tumult of her mind was now painfully great. she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhour. her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it. that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own casewas almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. but his pride his abominable pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room.   elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr. darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad. the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground. after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park. the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr. darcy she was directly retreating. but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name. she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy she moved again towards the gate. he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. will you do me the honour of reading that letter? and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight. with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper written quite through in a very close hand. the envelope itself was likewise full. pursuing her way along the lane she then began it. it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read. you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice. two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge. the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr. bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham. wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd. i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. i had often seen him in love before. at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided. from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him. your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in error. your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable. but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason. my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me. these causes must be stated though briefly. the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father. pardon me. it pains me to offend you. but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is now to be explained. his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. i described and enforced them earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference. he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard. but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment. i cannot blame myself for having done thus much. there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town. i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best. on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer. if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them. with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr. wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education. my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it. as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr. darcy could not have. here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell. but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real characterit adds even another motive. my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allowand if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr. wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited. he had some intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds. all connection between us seemed now dissolved. i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town. in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad. he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions. you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition to it. his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. how he lived i know not. but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy. my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself. about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr. wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself. i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me. you may imagine what i felt and how i acted. regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr. wickham who left the place immediately and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge. mr. wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. his revenge would have been complete indeed. this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham. i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. i will only add god bless you. fitzwilliam darcy   if elizabeth when mr. darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal. with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield. she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty. it was all pride and insolence. but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her. she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false! this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again. in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr. darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words. so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great. what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate. she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success. on both sides it was only assertion. again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr. darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole. the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr. wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice. she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance. of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself. as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring. his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. but no such recollection befriended her. she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read. but alas! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question. at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration. she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. phillipss. many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before. she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcythat mr. darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week. she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr. darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything. his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr. darcy she could not but allow that mr. bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had his actions been what mr. wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr. bingley was incomprehensible. she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd. how despicably i have acted! she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment! i who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! how humiliating is this discovery! yet how just a humiliation! had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind! but vanity not love has been my folly. pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned. till this moment i never knew myself. from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again. widely different was the effect of a second perusal. how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other? he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane. she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility. when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe. the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before. after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thoughtreconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr. darcy only for a few minutes to take leavebut that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it. colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object she could think only of her letter.   the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr. collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been. what would she have said? how would she have behaved? were questions with which she amused herself. their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party. i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do. but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me! they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are. the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year. his attachment to rosings certainly increases. mr. collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter. lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. mrs. collins will be very glad of your company i am sure. i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it. i must be in town next saturday. why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks. i expected you to stay two months. i told mrs. collins so before you came. there can be no occasion for your going so soon. mrs. bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight. but my father cannot. he wrote last week to hurry my return. oh! your father of course may spare you if your mother can. daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouchebox there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large. you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan. lady catherine seemed resigned. mrs. collins you must send a servant with them. you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. it is highly improper. you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life. when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two menservants go with her. miss darcy the daughter of mr. darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. i am excessively attentive to all those things. you must send john with the young ladies mrs. collins. i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone. my uncle is to send a servant for us. oh! your uncle! he keeps a manservant does he? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. where shall you change horses? oh! bromley of course. if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to. lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was. reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections. mr. darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin. they were hopeless of remedy. her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil. elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement? catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing. they were ignorant idle and vain. while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there forever. anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr. darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost. his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family! when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh. when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.   on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary. i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs. collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you. we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly. elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged. mr. collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. you see on what a footing we are. you see how continually we are engaged there. in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings. words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences. you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin. i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. lady catherines great attentions to mrs. collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent. only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking. there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. we seem to have been designed for each other. elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion. her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms. at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready. after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner though unknown. he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings. but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here. elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off. good gracious! cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened! a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh. we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice! how much i shall have to tell! elizabeth added privately and how much i shall have to conceal! their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiners house where they were to remain a few days. jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation. it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr. darcys proposals. to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further.   it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs. these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad and cucumber. after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise? and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there. then showing her purchaseslook here i have bought this bonnet. i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not. i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better. and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable. besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight. are they indeed! cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction. they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all. mamma would like to go too of all things! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have! yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once. good heaven! brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton! now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down at table. what do you think? it is excellent newscapital newsand about a certain person we all like! jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told he need not stay. lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion. you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say. but he is an ugly fellow! i am glad he is gone. i never saw such a long chin in my life. well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is it not? there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king. theres for you! she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay. wickham is safe. and mary king is safe! added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune. she is a great fool for going away if she liked him. but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane. i am sure there is not on his. i will answer for it he never cared three straws about herwho could about such a nasty little freckled thing? elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal! as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it. how nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia. i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home. and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare. she is almost threeandtwenty! lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before threeandtwenty! my aunt phillips wants you so to get husbands you cant think. she says lizzy had better have taken mr. collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it. lord! how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls. dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters. kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs. forster and me are such friends! and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did? we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun! not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs. forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked! when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least. lord! how i laughed! and so did mrs. forster. i thought i should have died. and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter. with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn. elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name. their reception at home was most kind. mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy. their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects that occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs. bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her. oh! mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun! as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too. and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought we never should have got into the coach. i was ready to die of laughter. and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles off! to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures! they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. but i confess they would have no charms for mei should infinitely prefer a book. but of this answer lydia heard not a word. she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all. in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. there was another reason too for her opposition. she dreaded seeing mr. wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. in a fortnight they were to goand once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account. she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents. elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.   elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself. miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him. his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment! indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. you do not blame me however for refusing him? blame you! oh no. but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham? noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did. but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next day. she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham. what a stroke was this for poor jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual. nor was darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery. most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear the one without involving the other. this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one. there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcys but you shall do as you choose. it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane. i do not know when i have been more shocked said she. wickham so very bad! it is almost past belief. and poor mr. darcy! dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered. such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! it is really too distressing. i am sure you must feel it so. oh! no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather. poor wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner! there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it. i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do. and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason. it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty. lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now. indeed i could not. i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy. and with no one to speak to about what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had! oh! how i wanted you! how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved. certainly. but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. there is one point on which i want your advice. i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understand wickhams character. miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. what is your opinion? that it ought not to be attempted. mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me? the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. i am not equal to it. wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. at present i will say nothing about it. you are quite right. to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character. we must not make him desperate. the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation. she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either. but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure. she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value! she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits. jane was not happy. she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley. having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity. well lizzy said mrs. bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes? for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. i told my sister phillips so the other day. but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london. well he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of everybody too who is likely to know. i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more. oh well! it is just as he chooses. nobody wants him to come. though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it. well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done. but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer. well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they? well well i only hope it will last. and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say. if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough. there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say. no nothing at all. a great deal of good management depend upon it. yes yes. they will take care not to outrun their income. they will never be distressed for money. well much good may it do them! and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. they look upon it as quite their own i dare say whenever that happens. it was a subject which they could not mention before me. no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better. i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.   the first week of their return was soon gone. the second began. it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. the dejection was almost universal. the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments. very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family. good heaven! what is to become of us? what are we to do? would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. how can you be smiling so lizzy? their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion fiveandtwenty years ago. i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millers regiment went away. i thought i should have broken my heart. i am sure i shall break mine said lydia. if one could but go to brighton! observed mrs. bennet. oh yes!if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable. a little seabathing would set me up forever. and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty. such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house. elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. she felt anew the justice of mr. darcys objections and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs. forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton. this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married. a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two. the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs. forster the delight of mrs. bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described. wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend. i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older. in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned. as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home. he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances. if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent mannernay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair. already arisen? repeated mr. bennet. what has she frightened away some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. come let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly. indeed you are mistaken. i have no such injuries to resent. it is not of particular but of general evils which i am now complaining. our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character. excuse me for i must speak plainly. if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger kitty also is comprehended. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled! oh! my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace? mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love. wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery silly sisters. we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton. let her go then. colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. the officers will find women better worth their notice. let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life. with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry. it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition. had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers. she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. she saw all the glories of the campits tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once. had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations? they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same. lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself. but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home. elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time. having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so. she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her. she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal. on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr. darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former. he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him. her answer was warmly in his favour. with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say he was at rosings? nearly three weeks. and you saw him frequently? yes almost every day. his manners are very different from his cousins. yes very different. but i think mr. darcy improves upon acquaintance. indeed! cried mr. wickham with a look which did not escape her. and pray may i ask? but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves? has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials. oh no! said elizabeth. in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was. while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood. wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feeling towards mr. darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by. i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart. elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him. the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning. the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy. mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.   had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given. elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband. she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible. but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a wateringplace and a camp. upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment. her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect. but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for. were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain. but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation. when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short. those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs. forster called her and they were going off to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public. after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn. everything wore a happier aspect. the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose. mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton. the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire. in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak. elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough. but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again. with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected. it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner. but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me. the period of expectation was now doubled. four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival. but they did pass away and mr. and mrs. gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn. the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them. the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad. it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc. are sufficiently known. a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern. to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs. gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated. it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it. in talking over their route the evening before mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. mr. gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation. my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much? said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. wickham passed all his youth there you know. elizabeth was distressed. she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains. mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity. if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful. they have some of the finest woods in the country. elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce. the possibility of meeting mr. darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred. it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk. but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered. accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor? and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer? a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. to pemberley therefore they were to go.   elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter. the park was very large and contained great variety of ground. they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent. elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. they gradually ascended for halfamile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound. it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance. its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. elizabeth was delighted. she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something! they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was. the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her. they followed her into the diningparlour. it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up. elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect. the hill crowned with wood which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object. every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight. as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen. the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings. and of this place thought she i might have been mistress! with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted! instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. but norecollecting herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them. this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very like regret. she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not the courage for it. at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs. reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends. how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! her aunt now called her to look at a picture. she approached and saw the likeness of mr. wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantelpiece. her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it. the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense. he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild. mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it. and that said mrs. reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my masterand very like him. it was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago. i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs. gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face. but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not. mrs. reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master. does that young lady know mr. darcy? elizabeth coloured and said a little. and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam? yes very handsome. i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this. this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. he was very fond of them. this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickhams being among them. mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old. and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother? said mrs. gardiner. oh! yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished!she plays and sings all day long. in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him. mr. gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs. reynolds either by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year? not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months. except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate. if your master would marry you might see more of him. yes sir but i do not know when that will be. i do not know who is good enough for him. mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled. elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so. i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him replied the other. elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old. this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas. that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion. her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said. you are lucky in having such a master. yes sir i know i am. if i were to go through the world i could not meet with a better. but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the world. elizabeth almost stared at her. can this be mr. darcy? thought she. his father was an excellent man said mrs. gardiner. yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor. elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more. mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point. she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain. mr. gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase. he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves. there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it. to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men. in what an amiable light does this place him! thought elizabeth. this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend. perhaps we might be deceived. that is not very likely our authority was too good. on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley. he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows. mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room. and this is always the way with him she added. whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. there is nothing he would not do for her. the picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown. in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible. in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance to mr. darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. mrs. reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime. there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature. what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship!how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!how much of good or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression. when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the halldoor. as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables. they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight. their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility. she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it. they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family. amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts. at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave. the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence. she was overpowered by shame and vexation. her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world! how strange it must appear to him! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come? or why did he thus come a day before he was expected? had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean? that he should even speak to her was amazing!but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand! she knew not what to think or how to account for it. they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene. her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr. darcy then was. she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him. perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease. whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure. at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself. they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream. mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk. with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts. they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it. elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs. gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr. gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little. whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them and at no great distance. the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met. elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them. for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them. with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. her colour changed and she said no more. mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are? he takes them now for people of fashion. the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. that he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner. elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph. it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners. the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr. darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. mrs. gardiner who was walking arminarm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder. elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself. her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered? from what can it proceed? it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this. it is impossible that he should still love me. after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration. it originated in mrs. gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands. mr. darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together. after a short silence the lady first spoke. she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country. he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr. bingley and his sisters. elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingleys name had been the last mentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged. there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you. will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton? the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her. they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought. elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased. his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn. at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward. she wanted to talk but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance. yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the ttette was over. on mr. and mrs. gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house. the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle. there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming. i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it. i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention. his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling. to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good. but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable? elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle. your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds. elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but said nothing. from what we have seen of him continued mrs. gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham. he has not an illnatured look. on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. but to be sure the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue. elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire. in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on. mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance. the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr. darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.   elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton these visitors came. they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business. nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing. she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her. she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse. miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place. with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable. miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful. she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings. they had not long been together before mr. darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room. all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done. to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. they had long wished to see him. the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention. the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough. elizabeth on her side had much to do. she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased. in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance. but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane. no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared. he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months. we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield. elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn. there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning. it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day. when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgracewhen she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings. their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour and when they arose to depart mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country. miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed. mrs. gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head. presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on. bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends. elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last halfhour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little. eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress. but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication. it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her. they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry. of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find. they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr. darcy. there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected. neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit. it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor. with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr. darcy afterwards discharged. as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. she certainly did not hate him. no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called. the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced. but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister. such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined. she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses. it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning. they were therefore to go. elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply. mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast. the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon.   convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed. on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn. in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london. georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. mrs. gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her. by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments. it was first broken by mrs. annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others and between her and mrs. gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on. miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard. elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention. this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. her own thoughts were employing her. she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine. after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family. she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more. the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post. there was now employment for the whole partyfor though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table. while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came. he had been some time with mr. gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning. no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over. miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side. miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton? they must be a great loss to your family. in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes. had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement. to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own. he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more. her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully. their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress. but georgiana would not join her. her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgement could not err. and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning mr. darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again. however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her. her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome. her nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines. her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything extraordinary in them. they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable. persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected. he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty!i should as soon call her mother a wit. but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time. yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first saw her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance. he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself. mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both. the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruitof everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject.   elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill. they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves. the one missent must first be attended to it had been written five days ago. the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence. it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well. what i have to say relates to poor lydia. an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham! imagine our surprise. to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected. i am very very sorry. so imprudent a match on both sides! but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood. thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart. his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing. our poor mother is sadly grieved. my father bears it better. how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves. they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. the express was sent off directly. my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us. colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention. i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother. i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written. without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first. by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent. dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed. imprudent as the marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland. colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express. though lydias short letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w. never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm set off from b. intending to trace their route. he did trace them easily to clapham but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom. all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road. i know not what to think. after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f. came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any successno such people had been seen to pass through. with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f. but no one can throw any blame on them. our distress my dear lizzy is very great. my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him. many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything? impossible! i grieve to find however that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w. was not a man to be trusted. my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected. and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected. poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder. i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient. adieu! i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former. my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her. what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening. in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness. oh! where where is my uncle? cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr. darcy appeared. her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you. i must find mr. gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose. good god! what is the matter? cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr. and mrs. gardiner. you are not well enough you cannot go yourself. elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly. on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid. is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? a glass of wine shall i get you one? you are very ill. no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself. there is nothing the matter with me. i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn. she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word. darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence. at length she spoke again. i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news. it cannot be concealed from anyone. my younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself into the power ofof mr. wickham. they are gone off together from brighton. you know him too well to doubt the rest. she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever. darcy was fixed in astonishment. when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it! i who knew what he was. had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family! had his character been known this could not have happened. but it is allall too late now. i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked. but is it certainabsolutely certain? oh yes! they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland. and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her? my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in halfanhour. but nothing can be donei know very well that nothing can be done. how is such a man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have not the smallest hope. it is every way horrible! darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence. when my eyes were opened to his real characteroh! had i known what i ought what i dared to do! but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much. wretched wretched mistake! darcy made no answer. he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy. elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it. her power was sinking everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress. it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain. but self though it would intrude could not engross her. lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern. would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today. oh yes. be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy. say that urgent business calls us home immediately. conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long. he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away. as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination. if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. but if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her. no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation. surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. but now it was all too natural. for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion. her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh! how acutely did she now feel it! she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy. though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr. gardiner promised every assistance in his power. elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. they were to be off as soon as possible. but what is to be done about pemberley? cried mrs. gardiner. john told us mr. darcy was here when you sent for us was it so? yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. that is all settled. that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare. and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? oh that i knew how it was! but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure. an hour however saw the whole completed and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn.   i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best. could he expect that her friends would not step forward? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is not adequate to the risk! do you really think so? cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment. upon my word said mrs. gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion. it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of. i cannot think so very ill of wickham. can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it? not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable. if indeed it should be so! but i dare not hope it. why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case? in the first place replied mr. gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland. oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road. well thensupposing them to be in london. they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose. it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland. but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their marriage be private? oh no nothis is not likely. his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. wickham will never marry a woman without some money. he cannot afford it. and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good. lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter. but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage? it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. but really i know not what to say. perhaps i am not doing her justice. but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last halfyear nay for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head. she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough. and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman. but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt. of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them? but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is. we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating. and do you really know all this? cried mrs. gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring. i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl. yet he knew to the contrary himself. he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her. but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand? oh yes!that that is the worst of all. till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself. and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time. as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. that such a consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts. when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other? not the slightest. i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were. every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites. it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey. from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent. fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness. they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day. it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her mothers apartment immediately met her. elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives. not yet replied jane. but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well. is my father in town? yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word. and have you heard from him often? we have heard only twice. he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do. he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention. and my motherhow is she? how are you all? my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken. she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. she does not yet leave her dressingroom. mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well. but youhow are you? cried elizabeth. you look pale. how much you must have gone through! her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears. when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give. the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage. mrs. bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing. if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her. why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am. poor dear child! and now heres mr. bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do. they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr. gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia. do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain. it is not quite a week since they left brighton. in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost. as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done. oh! my dear brother replied mrs. bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for. and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry. and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married. and above all keep mr. bennet from fighting. tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my witsand have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day. and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses. oh brother how kind you are! i know you will contrive it all. but mr. gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters. though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. one came from her books and the other from her toilette. the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty. as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of. but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation. then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply. mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them. in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy. after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard. give me further particulars. what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever. colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm. i am so grieved for him! his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey. and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know of their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself? yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of their plans and would not give his real opinion about it. he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before. and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married? how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step. she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks. but not before they went to brighton? no i believe not. and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself? does he know his real character? i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did. he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false. oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened! perhaps it would have been better replied her sister. but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable. we acted with the best intentions. could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife? he brought it with him for us to see. jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth. these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed. i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel. i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off. you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham. what a good joke it will be! i can hardly write for laughing. pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight. tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure. i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. goodbye. give my love to colonel forster. i hope you will drink to our good journey. your affectionate friend lydia bennet. oh! thoughtless thoughtless lydia! cried elizabeth when she had finished it. what a letter is this to be written at such a moment! but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. my poor father! how he must have felt it! i never saw anyone so shocked. he could not speak a word for full ten minutes. my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion! oh! jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day? i do not know. i hope there was. but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties. your attendance upon her has been too much for you. you do not look well. oh that i had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone. mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them. kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me. she was of great use and comfort to us all. and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they should be of use to us. she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours. assistance is impossible condolence insufferable. let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied. she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter. he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham. it had come with a fare from london and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham. if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.   the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off. when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel. mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them upthough as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them. all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light. he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family. everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them. mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings. mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it. he added that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon. there was also a postscript to this effect i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence. at present we have nothing to guide us. colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person. elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years. it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to. every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. the arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience. through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance. but before they heard again from mr. gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr. collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise. it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire. be assured my dear sir that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind. the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age. howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair. they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family? and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. let me then advise you dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense. i am dear sir etc. etc. mr. gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living. his former acquaintances had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton. he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still more formidable. mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family. jane heard them with horror. a gamester! she cried. this is wholly unexpected. i had not an idea of it. mr. gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday. rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. when mrs. bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. what is he coming home and without poor lydia? she cried. sure he will not leave london before he has found them. who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away? as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and the children should go to london at the same time that mr. bennet came from it. the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn. mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs. gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing. elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley. the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better. it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two. when mr. bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it. it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that. who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it. you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth. you may well warn me against such an evil. human nature is so prone to fall into it! no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame. i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. it will pass away soon enough. do you suppose them to be in london? yes where else can they be so well concealed? and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty. she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration. then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind. they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea. this is a parade he cried which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away. i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully. if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia. you go to brighton. i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds! no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it. no officer is ever to enter into my house again nor even to pass through the village. balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters. and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner. kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry. well well said he do not make yourself unhappy. if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them.   two days after mr. bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask. what do you mean hill? we have heard nothing from town. dear madam cried mrs. hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner? he has been here this halfhour and master has had a letter. away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech. they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse. upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock. jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what newswhat news? have you heard from my uncle? yes i have had a letter from him by express. well and what news does it bringgood or bad? what is there of good to be expected? said he taking the letter from his pocket. but perhaps you would like to read it. elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. jane now came up. read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about. gracechurch street monday august 2. my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction. soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were. the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered. i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married! elizabeth read on i have seen them both. they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are. all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum. these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you. i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr. wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune. if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quiet at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care. send back your answer as fast as you can and be careful to write explicitly. we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve. she comes to us today. i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. yours etc. edw. gardiner. is it possible? cried elizabeth when she had finished. can it be possible that he will marry her? wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said her sister. my dear father i congratulate you. and have you answered the letter? cried elizabeth. no but it must be done soon. most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. oh! my dear father she cried come back and write immediately. consider how important every moment is in such a case. let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself. i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done. and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house. and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with. complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little. and they must marry! yet he is such a man! yes yes they must marry. there is nothing else to be done. but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how am i ever to pay him. money! my uncle! cried jane what do you mean sir? i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone. that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before. his debts to be discharged and something still to remain! oh! it must be my uncles doings! generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself. a small sum could not do all this. no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship. ten thousand pounds! heaven forbid! how is half such a sum to be repaid? mr. bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house. their father then went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom. and they are really to be married! cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves. how strange this is! and for this we are to be thankful. that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice. oh lydia! i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her. though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced. he has children of his own and may have more. how could he spare half ten thousand pounds? if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own. the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt! we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy. his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking. their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten. their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget. it is useless to talk of it. it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please. may we take my uncles letter to read to her? take whatever you like and get away. elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went up stairs together. mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet one communication would therefore do for all. after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud. mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself. as soon as jane had read mr. gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance. she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. to know that her daughter would be married was enough. she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct. my dear dear lydia! she cried. this is delightful indeed! she will be married! i shall see her again! she will be married at sixteen! my good kind brother! i knew how it would be. i knew he would manage everything! how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the clothes the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly. lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her. stay stay i will go myself. ring the bell kitty for hill. i will put on my things in a moment. my dear dear lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet! her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiners behaviour laid them all under. for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness. we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money. well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle? if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents. well! i am so happy! in a short time i shall have a daughter married. mrs. wickham! how well it sounds! and she was only sixteen last june. my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me. we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately. she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. other schemes too came into her head. i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips. and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long. kitty run down and order the carriage. an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure. girls can i do anything for you in meryton? oh! here comes hill! my dear hill have you heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding. mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy. elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom. poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful. she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.   mr. bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him. he now wished it more than ever. had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place. he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could. when first mr. bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son. the son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs. bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would. this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving. mrs. bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income. five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children. but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within that sum. that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence. his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution. he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her. the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farmhouse. but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain. it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been downstairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high. no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants. she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance. haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit itor the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is too far off! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful. her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs. bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding. into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn. a long dispute followed this declaration but mr. bennet was firm. it soon led to another and mrs. bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it. that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe possible. she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place. elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot. she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so muchnot however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them. had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned. from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what. she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet. what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph. she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her. his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes. it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgement information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance. but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family. how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine. but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture. mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. to mr. bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia. it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on. and i think you will agree with me in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces. it is mr. wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north. it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent. i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself. and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information? he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us. haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week. they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs. gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south. she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.yours etc. e. gardiner. mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr. gardiner could do. but mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it. lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites. she is so fond of mrs. forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away! and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much. the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment. his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative. but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished. and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north. when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn. elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.   their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime. their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. they came. the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy. lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room. her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. their reception from mr. bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial. his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips. the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him. elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked. lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless. she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there. wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all. elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour. there was no want of discourse. the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world. only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. good gracious! when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was. her father lifted up his eyes. jane was distressed. elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh! mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married today? i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything. elizabeth could bear it no longer. she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah! jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman. it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. her ease and good spirits increased. she longed to see mrs. phillips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs. wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs. hill and the two housemaids. well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband? is not he a charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. i only hope they may have half my good luck. they must all go to brighton. that is the place to get husbands. what a pity it is mamma we did not all go. very true and if i had my will we should. but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off. must it be so? oh lord! yesthere is nothing in that. i shall like it of all things. you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us. we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all. i should like it beyond anything! said her mother. and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over. i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands. their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home. these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not. wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him. she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. lydia was exceedingly fond of him. he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him. he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country. one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe. you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it. are not you curious to hear how it was managed? no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject. la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off. we were married you know at st. clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish. and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock. my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church. well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss! i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted. and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham. i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat. well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight. not one party or scheme or anything. to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open. well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone. and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it. well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out. however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr. darcy might have done as well. mr. darcy! repeated elizabeth in utter amazement. oh yes!he was to come there with wickham you know. but gracious me! i quite forgot! i ought not to have said a word about it. i promised them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such a secret! if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject. you may depend upon my seeking no further. oh! certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions. thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry. on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away. but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information. mr. darcy had been at her sisters wedding. it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go. conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none. those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable. she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended. you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time. pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance. not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out. janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her enquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante.   elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial. gracechurch street sept. 6. my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you. i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you. dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side. if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence. your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit. on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. mr. darcy called and was shut up with him several hours. it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once. from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. his character was to speak for itself. he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him. he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. there is a lady it seems a mrs. younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what. she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. this mrs. younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found. wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her. at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction. they were in street. he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia. his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go. but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham. she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when. since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design. he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone. he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it. he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on. mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. they met several times for there was much to be discussed. wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable. everything being settled between them mr. darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home. but mr. gardiner could not be seen and mr. darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning. he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. on saturday he came again. your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together. they met again on sunday and then i saw him too. it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn. but our visitor was very obstinate. i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all. he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one. nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due. but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most. you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people. his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased. the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above. it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event. but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. i believe i have now told you every thing. it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house. he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain. i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen. i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her. mr. darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding. he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday. will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him. his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire. his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him. i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name. but slyness seems the fashion. pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park. a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing. but i must write no more. the children have been wanting me this half hour. yours very sincerely m. gardiner. the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham. brotherinlaw of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. he had to be sure done much. she was ashamed to think how much. but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him. oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him. proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself. she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again. it was hardly enough but it pleased her. she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself. she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham. i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister? said he as he joined her. you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome. i should be sorry indeed if it were. we were always good friends and now we are better. true. are the others coming out? i do not know. mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton. and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley. she replied in the affirmative. i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose? poor reynolds she was always very fond of me. but of course she did not mention my name to you. yes she did. and what did she say? that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well. at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented. certainly he replied biting his lips. elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. we passed each other several times. i wonder what he can be doing there. perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth. it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year. undoubtedly. did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had. yes he introduced us to his sister. and do you like her? very much. i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. when i last saw her she was not very promising. i am very glad you liked her. i hope she will turn out well. i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age. did you go by the village of kympton? i do not recollect that we did. i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had. a most delightful place!excellent parsonage house! it would have suited me in every respect. how should you have liked making sermons? exceedingly well. i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing. one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me! the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! but it was not to be. did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent? i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron. you have. yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember. i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly. you did! and it was not wholly without foundation. you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it. they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr. wickham we are brother and sister you know. do not let us quarrel about the past. in future i hope we shall be always of one mind. she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house.   mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet. the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. oh! my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again? oh lord! i dont know. not these two or three years perhaps. write to me very often my dear. as often as i can. but you know married women have never much time for writing. my sisters may write to me. they will have nothing else to do. mr. wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes. he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things. he is as fine a fellow said mr. bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw. he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all. i am prodigiously proud of him. i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw. the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days. i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends. one seems so forlorn without them. this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth. it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single. it is no such thing. lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off. if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon. but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks. mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets. she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns. well well and so mr. bingley is coming down sister for mrs. phillips first brought her the news. well so much the better. not that i care about it though. he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again. but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it. and who knows what may happen? but that is nothing to us. you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. and so is it quite certain he is coming? you may depend on it replied the other for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true. he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday. she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed. miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed. but dont imagine it was from any silly cause. i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at. i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him. not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks. elizabeth did not know what to make of it. had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it. yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation! i will leave him to himself. in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them. the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again. as soon as ever mr. bingley comes my dear said mrs. bennet you will wait on him of course. no no. you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters. but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again. his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield. tis an etiquette i despise said he. if he wants our society let him seek it. he knows where we live. i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again. well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined. we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon. that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him. consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley in consequence of it before they did. as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister. it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says. happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over! i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power. you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much. mr. bingley arrived. mrs. bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before. but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house. her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr. darcy with him and sat down again by her sister. there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be? some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know. la! replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. mr. whatshisname. that tall proud man. good gracious! mr. darcy!and so it does i vow. well any friend of mr. bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him. jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. both sisters were uncomfortable enough. each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr. darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingleys friend without being heard by either of them. but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley. her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire. the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. but she would not be secure. let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation. she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance. elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command. she had ventured only one glance at darcy. he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley. but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture. bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend. elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied. darcy after enquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything. he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire. there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself. but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground. more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed. she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so. could i expect it to be otherwise! said she. yet why did he come? she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak. she enquired after his sister but could do no more. it is a long time mr. bingley since you went away said mrs. bennet. he readily agreed to it. i began to be afraid you would never come back again. people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true. a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away. miss lucas is married and settled. and one of my own daughters. i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers. it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be. it was only said lately george wickham esq. to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything. it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. did you see it? bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations. elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. how mr. darcy looked therefore she could not tell. it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr. bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long. his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars. thank heaven! he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves. elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. a few weeks he believed. when you have killed all your own birds mr. bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr. bennets manor. i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you. elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion. the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them. their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either one or the other again! yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover. when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty. jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent. when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time. you are quite a visit in my debt mr. bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned. i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement. bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. they then went away. mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.   as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. mr. darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her. why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all? she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me? if he fears me why come hither? if he no longer cares for me why silent? teasing teasing man! i will think no more about him. her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth. now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy. i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. i am glad he dines here on tuesday. it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance. yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly. oh jane take care. my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now? i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever. they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs. bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived. on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time. when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister. her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself. on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided. he placed himself by her. elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend. he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm. his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured. though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour. mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. he was on one side of her mother. she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage. she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family. she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend. if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever. the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas! the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shant come and part us i am determined. we want none of them do we? darcy had walked away to another part of the room. she followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings! she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still? yes she will remain there till christmas. and quite alone? have all her friends left her? mrs. annesley is with her. the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks. she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success. he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away. when the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. she now lost every expectation of pleasure. they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them. well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you. the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week and even mr. darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least. and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty. mrs. long said so too for i asked her whether you did not. and what do you think she said besides? ah! mrs. bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last. she did indeed. i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously. mrs. bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals. it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth. the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other. i hope we may often meet again. elizabeth smiled. lizzy you must not do so. you must not suspect me. it mortifies me. i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection. it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man. you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment. how hard it is in some cases to be believed! and how impossible in others! but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge? that is a question which i hardly know how to answer. we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante.   a few days after this visit mr. bingley called again and alone. his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time. he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits. mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky. he should be particularly happy at any time etc. etc. and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them. can you come tomorrow? yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity. he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down. he is comemr. bingley is come. he is indeed. make haste make haste. here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown. never mind miss lizzys hair. we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago. oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come be quick be quick! where is your sash my dear? but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. after tea mr. bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument. two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them. elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma? what do you keep winking at me for? what am i to do? nothing child nothing. i did not wink at you. she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room. jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. in a few minutes mrs. bennet halfopened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you. elizabeth was forced to go. we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall. kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressingroom. elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom. mrs. bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual. bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter. his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter. he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs. bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband. after this day jane said no more of her indifference. not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time. seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence. bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on. the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him. bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs. bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes. but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all. their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse. not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room. jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world. tis too much! she added by far too much. i do not deserve it. oh! why is not everybody as happy? elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express. every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane. but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present. i must go instantly to my mother she cried. i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. he is gone to my father already. oh! lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall i bear so much happiness! she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty. elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation. and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection! of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance! the happiest wisest most reasonable end! in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. where is your sister? said he hastily as he opened the door. with my mother up stairs. she will be down in a moment i dare say. he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself. it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever. kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon. mrs. bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr. bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was. not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you. you will be a very happy woman. jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness. you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. i have not a doubt of your doing very well together. your tempers are by no means unlike. you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income. i hope not so. imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me. exceed their income! my dear mr. bennet cried his wife what are you talking of? why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more. then addressing her daughter oh! my dear dear jane i am so happy! i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night. i knew how it would be. i always said it must be so at last. i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together. oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen! wickham lydia were all forgotten. jane was beyond competition her favourite child. at that moment she cared for no other. her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense. mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter. bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept. elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief. he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed it possible. i suspected as much replied elizabeth. but how did he account for it? it must have been his sisters doing. they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other. that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter. good girl! it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard. would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again! he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty. this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities. elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him. i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed! cried jane. oh! lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all! if i could but see you as happy! if there were but such another man for you! if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you. till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness. no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr. collins in time. the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret. mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton. the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.   one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them. as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery. they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. it was lady catherine de bourgh. they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs. bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt. she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word. elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made. mrs. bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness. after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet. that lady i suppose is your mother. elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. and that i suppose is one of your sisters. yes madam said mrs. bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine. she is my youngest girl but one. my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family. you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence. it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass. this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west. mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well. yes very well. i saw them the night before last. elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled. mrs. bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company. go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the different walks. i think she will be pleased with the hermitage. elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs. as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on. her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it. they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. how could i ever think her like her nephew? said she as she looked in her face. as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither. your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come. elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment. indeed you are mistaken madam. i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here. miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with. but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so. my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it. a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr. darcy. though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you. if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. what could your ladyship propose by it? at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted. your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence. if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad? i never heard that it was. and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it? i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer. this is not to be borne. miss bennet i insist on being satisfied. has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage? your ladyship has declared it to be impossible. it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason. but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. you may have drawn him in. if i have i shall be the last person to confess it. miss bennet do you know who i am? i have not been accustomed to such language as this. i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns. but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit. let me be rightly understood. this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place. no never. mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter. now what have you to say? only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me. lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. from their infancy they have been intended for each other. it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers. while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin? yes and i had heard it before. but what is that to me? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh. you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. its completion depended on others. if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice? and if i am that choice why may not i accept him? because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it. yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. you will be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him. your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us. these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth. but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine. obstinate headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to me on that score? let us sit down. you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it. i have not been used to submit to any persons whims. i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment. that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me. i will not be interrupted. hear me in silence. my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancientthough untitledfamilies. their fortune on both sides is splendid. they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune. is this to be endured! but it must not shall not be. if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up. in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal. true. you are a gentlemans daughter. but who was your mother? who are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition. whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you. tell me once for all are you engaged to him? though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation i am not. lady catherine seemed pleased. and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement? i will make no promise of the kind. miss bennet i am shocked and astonished. i expected to find a more reasonable young woman. but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede. i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require. and i certainly never shall give it. i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged. you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these. how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject. not so hasty if you please. i have by no means done. to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add. i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement. i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles. and is such a girl to be my nephews sister? is her husband who is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother? heaven and earth!of what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted? you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered. you have insulted me in every possible method. i must beg to return to the house. and she rose as she spoke. lady catherine rose also and they turned back. her ladyship was highly incensed. you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew! unfeeling selfish girl! do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody? lady catherine i have nothing further to say. you know my sentiments. you are then resolved to have him? i have said no such thing. i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me. it is well. you refuse then to oblige me. you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude. you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world. neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance. no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy. and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn. and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well. i shall now know how to act. do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified. i came to try you. i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point. in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet. i send no compliments to your mother. you deserve no such attention. i am most seriously displeased. elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself. she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself. she did not choose it said her daughter she would go. she is a very finelooking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well. she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you. i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy? elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.   the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy. it was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea. she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time. in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce. she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side. with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning. if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. in that case he would return no more. lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way. if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it. i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy. if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all. the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject. the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand. lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room. she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations. she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down. he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents. i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. let me congratulate you on a very important conquest. the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious. young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer. this letter is from mr. collins. from mr. collins! and what can he have to say? something very much to the purpose of course. he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases. i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point. what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority. your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land. can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this? this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage. yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of. have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is? but now it comes out my motive for cautioning you is as follows. we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye. mr. darcy you see is the man! now lizzy i think i have surprised you. could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? mr. darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life! it is admirable! elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile. never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. are you not diverted? oh! yes. pray read on. after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned. mr. collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it. you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing. that is his notion of christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch. but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it. you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn? oh! cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted. but it is so strange! yesthat is what makes it amusing. had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr. collinss correspondence for any consideration. nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw. and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report? did she call to refuse her consent? to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it. elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried. her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr. darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much.   instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit. the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out. it was agreed to. mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together. bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them. they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other. very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same. they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr. darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours. i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express. i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness. i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted. you must not blame my aunt. lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars. let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them. if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone. that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny. but your family owe me nothing. much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you. elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me. if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once. my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever. elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable. they walked on without knowing in what direction. there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects. she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise. it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly. elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations. what did you say of me that i did not deserve? for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. it was unpardonable. i cannot think of it without abhorrence. we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth. the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility. i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me. your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner. those were your words. you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice. i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way. i can easily believe it. you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did. the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me. oh! do not repeat what i then said. these recollections will not do at all. i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it. darcy mentioned his letter. did it said he did it soon make you think better of me? did you on reading it give any credit to its contents? she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed. i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary. i hope you have destroyed the letter. there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again. i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me. the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies. when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit. the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so. the adieu is charity itself. but think no more of the letter. the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. you must learn some of my philosophy. think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure. i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of innocence. but with me it is not so. painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled. i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle. as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper. i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit. unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous. by you i was properly humbled. i came to you without a doubt of my reception. you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased. had you then persuaded yourself that i should? indeed i had. what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses. my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you. i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong. how you must have hated me after that evening? hate you! i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction. i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley. you blamed me for coming? no indeed i felt nothing but surprise. your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due. my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you. he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend. she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther. after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home. what could become of mr. bingley and jane! was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it. i must ask whether you were surprised? said elizabeth. not at all. when i went away i felt that it would soon happen. that is to say you had given your permission. i guessed as much. and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case. on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago. i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. his surprise was great. he had never had the slightest suspicion. i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together. elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend. did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring? from the former. i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here and i was convinced of her affection. and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him. it did. bingley is most unaffectedly modest. his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him. i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him. he was angry. but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments. he has heartily forgiven me now. elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself. she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin. in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house. in the hall they parted.   my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to? was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to table. she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge. she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth. the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary. the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent. darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her. she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. at night she opened her heart to jane. though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here. you are joking lizzy. this cannot be!engaged to mr. darcy! no no you shall not deceive me. i know it to be impossible. this is a wretched beginning indeed! my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not. yet indeed i am in earnest. i speak nothing but the truth. he still loves me and we are engaged. jane looked at her doubtingly. oh lizzy! it cannot be. i know how much you dislike him. you know nothing of the matter. that is all to be forgot. perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now. but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable. this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself. miss bennet still looked all amazement. elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth. good heaven! can it be really so! yet now i must believe you cried jane. my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you certain? forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him? there can be no doubt of that. it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. but are you pleased jane? shall you like to have such a brother? very very much. nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight. but we considered it we talked of it as impossible. and do you really love him quite well enough? oh lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do? oh yes! you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all. what do you mean? why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley. i am afraid you will be angry. my dearest sister now be serious. i want to talk very seriously. let me know every thing that i am to know without delay. will you tell me how long you have loved him? it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began. but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley. another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish. now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself. i always had a value for him. were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me. but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me. how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know of it to another not to you. elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage. all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation. good gracious! cried mrs. bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company. what shall we do with him? lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way. elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs. bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today? i advise mr. darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs. bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning. it is a nice long walk and mr. darcy has never seen the view. it may do very well for the others replied mr. bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty. wont it kitty? kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented. as she went up stairs to get ready mrs. bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then. so do not put yourself to inconvenience. during their walk it was resolved that mr. bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening. elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers. she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation. in the evening soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her meansthat she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile. in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library. she was gone directly. her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious. lizzy said he what are you doing? are you out of your senses to be accepting this man? have not you always hated him? how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr. darcy. or in other words you are determined to have him. he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane. but will they make you happy? have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference? none at all. we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him. i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him. indeed he has no improper pride. he is perfectly amiable. you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms. lizzy said her father i have given him my consent. he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask. i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him. but let me advise you to think better of it. i know your disposition lizzy. i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior. your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. you could scarcely escape discredit and misery. my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. you know not what you are about. elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match. well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say. if this be the case he deserves you. i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy. to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia. he heard her with astonishment. this is an evening of wonders indeed! and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission! so much the better. it will save me a world of trouble and economy. had it been your uncles doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter. he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr. collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure. elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time. when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication. its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs. bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable. nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself. good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr. darcy! who would have thought it! and is it really true? oh! my sweetest lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have! janes is nothing to itnothing at all. i am so pleasedso happy. such a charming man!so handsome! so tall!oh my dear lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. i hope he will overlook it. dear dear lizzy. a house in town! every thing that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh lord! what will become of me. i shall go distracted. this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away. but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her. my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else! ten thousand a year and very likely more! tis as good as a lord! and a special licence. you must and shall be married by a special licence. but my dearest love tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow. this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for. but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion. elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem. i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he. wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as janes.   elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. how could you begin? said she. i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place? i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun. my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence? for the liveliness of your mind i did. you may as well call it impertinence at once. it was very little less. the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention. you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone. i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them. had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable. to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love. was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield? dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make a virtue of it by all means. my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here? why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me? because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement. but i was embarrassed. and so was i. you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner. a man who had felt less might. how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself. i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for i ought not to have mentioned the subject. this will never do. you need not distress yourself. the moral will be perfectly fair. lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing. lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use. but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence? my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me. my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made. shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her? i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth. but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly. and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did. but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected. from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write. you supposed more than really existed. but now suppose as much as you choose give a loose rein to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err. you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes. how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the ponies is delightful. we will go round the park every day. i am the happiest creature in the world. perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice. i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh. mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. you are all to come to pemberley at christmas. yours etc. mr. darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins in reply to his last. dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations. elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy. console lady catherine as well as you can. but if i were you i would stand by the nephew. he has more to give. yours sincerely etc. miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard. jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved. the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it. four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister. before any answer could arrive from mr. collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. he bore it however with admirable calmness. he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st. jamess with very decent composure. if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight. mrs. phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs. phillips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar. nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant. elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley.   happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley and talked of mrs. darcy may be guessed. i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly. mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected. mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth. so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart. the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other. kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great. she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid. from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going. mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennets being quite unable to sit alone. mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished. the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy. if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy. it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us. i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr. darcy about it if you had rather not. yours etc. as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them. it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme. they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought. his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her. though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession. lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone. miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth. pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see. they were able to love each other even as well as they intended. georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother. he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry. her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself. lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end. but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them.\n",

struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of speciesthat mystery of mysteries as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. on my return home it occurred to me in 1837 that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. after five years work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject and drew up some short notes these i enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed to me probable from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object. i hope that i may be excused for entering on these personal details as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision. my work is now nearly finished but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it and as my health is far from strong i have been urged to publish this abstract. i have more especially been induced to do this as mr. wallace who is now studying the natural history of the malay archipelago has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that i have on the origin of species. last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject with a request that i would forward it to sir charles lyell who sent it to the linnean society and it is published in the third volume of the journal of that society. sir c. lyell and dr. hooker who both knew of my workthe latter having read my sketch of 1844honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish with mr. wallaces excellent memoir some brief extracts from my manuscripts. this abstract which i now publish must necessarily be imperfect. i cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy. no doubt errors will have crept in though i hope i have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. i can here give only the general conclusions at which i have arrived with a few facts in illustration but which i hope in most cases will suffice. no one can feel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts with references on which my conclusions have been grounded and i hope in a future work to do this. for i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived. a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question and this cannot possibly be here done. i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many naturalists some of them personally unknown to me. i cannot however let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr. hooker who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment. in considering the origin of species it is quite conceivable that a naturalist reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their embryological relations their geographical distribution geological succession and other such facts might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created but had descended like varieties from other species. nevertheless such a conclusion even if well founded would be unsatisfactory until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration. naturalists continually refer to external conditions such as climate food etc. as the only possible cause of variation. in one very limited sense as we shall hereafter see this may be true but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions the structure for instance of the woodpecker with its feet tail beak and tongue so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. in the case of the misseltoe which draws its nourishment from certain trees which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite with its relations to several distinct organic beings by the effects of external conditions or of habit or of the volition of the plant itself. the author of the vestiges of creation would i presume say that after a certain unknown number of generations some bird had given birth to a woodpecker and some plant to the misseltoe and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life untouched and unexplained. it is therefore of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation. at the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem. nor have i been disappointed in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge imperfect though it be of variation under domestication afforded the best and safest clue. i may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists. abstract to variation under domestication. we shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible and what is equally or more important we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations. i will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature but i shall unfortunately be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. we shall however be enabled to discuss what circumstances existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world which inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase will be treated of. this is the doctrine of malthus applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive and as consequently there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be naturally selected. from the strong principle of inheritance any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form. this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life and induces what i have called divergence of character. of variation and of correlation of growth. in the four succeeding be given namely first the difficulties of transitions or in understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ secondly the subject of instinct or the mental powers of animals thirdly hybridism or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and fourthly the consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time in the eleventh and twelfth their geographical distribution throughout space in the thirteenth their classification or mutual affinities shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work and a few concluding remarks. no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us. who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? yet these relations are of the highest importance for they determine the present welfare and as i believe the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history. although much remains obscure and will long remain obscure i can entertain no doubt after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable that the view which most naturalists entertain and which i formerly entertainednamely that each species has been independently createdis erroneous. i am fully convinced that species are not immutable but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.   variation under domestication.  causes of

circumstances favourable to mans power of selection.  when we look to the individuals of the same variety or subvariety of our older cultivated plants and animals one of the first points which strikes us is that they generally differ much more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. when we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment i think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as and somewhat different from those to which the parentspecies have been exposed under nature. there is also i think some probability in the view propounded by andrew knight that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. it seems pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation and that when the organisation has once begun to vary it generally continues to vary for many generations. no case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. our oldest cultivated plants such as wheat still often yield new varieties our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification. it has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability whatever they may be generally act whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo or at the instant of conception. geoffroy st. hilaires experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. but i am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception. several reasons make me believe in this but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the organisation to the action of any change in the conditions of life. nothing is more easy than to tame an animal and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement even in the many cases when the male and female unite. how many animals there are which will not breed though living long under not very close confinement in their native country! this is generally attributed to vitiated instincts but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour and yet rarely or never seed! in some few such cases it has been found out that very trifling changes such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed. i cannot here enter on the copious details which i have collected on this curious subject but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement i may just mention that carnivorous animals even from the tropics breed in this country pretty freely under confinement with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family whereas carnivorous birds with the rarest exceptions hardly ever lay fertile eggs. many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless in the same exact condition as in the most sterile hybrids. when on the one hand we see domesticated animals and plants though often weak and sickly yet breeding quite freely under confinement and when on the other hand we see individuals though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed longlived and healthy of which i could give numerous instances yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting we need not be surprised at this system when it does act under confinement acting not quite regularly and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or variable. sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture but on this view we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility and variability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden. i may add that as some organisms will breed most freely under the most unnatural conditions for instance the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches showing that their reproductive system has not been thus affected so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation and vary very slightlyperhaps hardly more than in a state of nature. a long list could easily be given of sporting plants by this term gardeners mean a single bud or offset which suddenly assumes a new and sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant. such buds can be propagated by grafting etc. and sometimes by seed. these sports are extremely rare under nature but far from rare under cultivation and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has affected a bud or offset and not the ovules or pollen. but it is the opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation so that in fact sports support my view that variability may be largely attributed to the ovules or pollen or to both having been affected by the treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception. these cases anyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected as some authors have supposed with the act of generation. seedlings from the same fruit and the young of the same litter sometimes differ considerably from each other though both the young and the parents as mller has remarked have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction and of growth and of inheritance for had the action of the conditions been direct if any of the young had varied all would probably have varied in the same manner. to judge how much in the case of any variation we should attribute to the direct action of heat moisture light food etc. is most difficult my impression is that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect though apparently more in the case of plants. under this point of view mr. buckmans recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable. when all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are affected in the same way the change at first appears to be directly due to such conditions but in some cases it can be shown that quite opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure. nevertheless some slight amount of change may i think be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of lifeas in some cases increased size from amount of food colour from particular kinds of food and from light and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate. habit also has a decided influence as in the period of flowering with plants when transported from one climate to another. in animals it has a more marked effect for instance i find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more in proportion to the whole skeleton than do the same bones in the wildduck and i presume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less and walking more than its wild parent. the great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked in comparison with the state of these organs in other countries is another instance of the effect of use. not a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears and the view suggested by some authors that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear from the animals not being much alarmed by danger seems probable. there are many laws regulating variation some few of which can be dimly seen and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. i will here only allude to what may be called correlation of growth. any change in the embryo or larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. in monstrosities the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious and many instances are given in isidore geoffroy st. hilaires great work on this subject. breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head. some instances of correlation are quite whimsical thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf colour and constitutional peculiarities go together of which many remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants. from the facts collected by heusinger it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons. hairless dogs have imperfect teeth longhaired and coarsehaired animals are apt to have as is asserted long or many horns pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes pigeons with short beaks have small feet and those with long beaks large feet. hence if man goes on selecting and thus augmenting any peculiarity he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth. the result of the various quite unknown or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified. it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants as on the hyacinth potato even the dahlia etc. and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and subvarieties differ slightly from each other. the whole organisation seems to have become plastic and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type. any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance is endless. dr. prosper lucass treatise in two large volumes is the fullest and the best on this subject. no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance like produces like is his fundamental belief doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone. when a deviation appears not unfrequently and we see it in the father and child we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same original cause acting on both but when amongst individuals apparently exposed to the same conditions any very rare deviation due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances appears in the parentsay once amongst several million individualsand it reappears in the child the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance. every one must have heard of cases of albinism prickly skin hairy bodies etc. appearing in several members of the same family. if strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable. perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject would be to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule and noninheritance as the anomaly. the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species and in individuals of different species is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one sex alone more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. it is a fact of some little importance to us that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively or in a much greater degree to males alone. a much more important rule which i think may be trusted is that at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age though sometimes earlier. in many cases this could not be otherwise thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity and not to its primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or male element in nearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a shorthorned cow by a longhorned bull the greater length of horn though appearing late in life is clearly due to the male element. having alluded to the subject of reversion i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalistsnamely that our domestic varieties when run wild gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks. hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made. there would be great difficulty in proving its truth we may safely conclude that very many of the most stronglymarked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. it would be quite necessary in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. nevertheless as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising or were to cultivate during many generations the several races for instance of the cabbage in very poor soil in which case however some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil that they would to a large extent or even wholly revert to the wild aboriginal stock. whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversionthat is to lose their acquired characters whilst kept under unchanged conditions and whilst kept in a considerable body so that free intercrossing might check by blending together any slight deviations of structure in such case i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view to assert that we could not breed our cart and racehorses long and shorthorned cattle and poultry of various breeds and esculent vegetables for an almost infinite number of generations would be opposed to all experience. i may add that when under nature the conditions of life do change variations and reversions of character probably do occur but natural selection as will hereafter be explained will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved. when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants and compare them with species closely allied together we generally perceive in each domestic race as already remarked less uniformity of character than in true species. domestic races of the same species also often have a somewhat monstrous character by which i mean that although differing from each other and from the other species of the same genus in several trifling respects they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part both when compared one with another and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied. with these exceptions and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crosseda subject hereafter to be discussed domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as only in most cases in a lesser degree than do closelyallied species of the same genus in a state of nature. i think this must be admitted when we find that there are hardly any domestic races either amongst animals or plants which have not been ranked by some competent judges as mere varieties and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species. if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur. it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value. i think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct but naturalists differ most widely in determining what characters are of generic value all such valuations being at present empirical. moreover on the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions. when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species we are soon involved in doubt from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parentspecies. this point if it could be cleared up would be interesting if for instance it could be shown that the greyhound bloodhound terrier spaniel and bulldog which we all know propagate their kind so truly were the offspring of any single species then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied and natural speciesfor instance of the many foxesinhabiting different quarters of the world. i do not believe as we shall presently see that all our dogs have descended from any one wild species but in the case of some other domestic races there is presumptive or even strong evidence in favour of this view. it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary and likewise to withstand diverse climates. i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions but how could a savage possibly know when he first tamed an animal whether it would vary in succeeding generations and whether it would endure other climates? has the little variability of the ass or guineafowl or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer or of cold by the common camel prevented their domestication? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants equal in number to our domesticated productions and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries were taken from a state of nature and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied. in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants i do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion whether they have descended from one or several species. the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is that we find in the most ancient records more especially on the monuments of egypt much diversity in the breeds and that some of the breeds closely resemble perhaps are identical with those still existing. even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case what does it show but that some of our breeds originated there four or five thousand years ago? but mr. horners researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods savages like those of tierra del fuego or australia who possess a semidomestic dog may not have existed in egypt? the whole subject must i think remain vague nevertheless i may without here entering on any details state that from geographical and other considerations i think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species. in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion. i should think from facts communicated to me by mr. blyth on the habits voice and constitution etc. of the humped indian cattle that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent. with respect to horses from reasons which i cannot give here i am doubtfully inclined to believe in opposition to several authors that all the races have descended from one wild stock. mr. blyth whose opinion from his large and varied stores of knowledge i should value more than that of almost any one thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl gallus bankiva. in regard to ducks and rabbits the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure i do not doubt that they all have descended from the common wild duck and rabbit. the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. they believe that every race which breeds true let the distinctive characters be ever so slight has had its wild prototype. at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle as many sheep and several goats in europe alone and several even within great britain. one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it! when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely and so with hungary spain etc. but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle sheep etc. we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe for whence could they have been derived as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parentstocks? so it is in india. even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world which i fully admit have probably descended from several wild species i cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. who can believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound the bloodhound the bulldog or blenheim spaniel etc.so unlike all wild canidever existed freely in a state of nature? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species but by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents and if we account for our several domestic races by this process we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms as the italian greyhound bloodhound bulldog etc. in the wild state. moreover the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. there can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels which present any desired character but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species i can hardly believe. sir j. sebright expressly experimentised for this object and failed. the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes as i have found with pigeons extremely uniform and everything seems simple enough but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations hardly two of them will be alike and then the extreme difficulty or rather utter hopelessness of the task becomes apparent. certainly a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and longcontinued selection nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed. on the breeds of the domestic pigeon.believing that it is always best to study some special group i have after deliberation taken up domestic pigeons. i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world more especially by the honourable w. elliot from india and by the honourable c. murray from persia. many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons and some of them are very important as being of considerable antiquity. i have associated with several eminent fanciers and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs. the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing. compare the english carrier and the shortfaced tumbler and see the wonderful difference in their beaks entailing corresponding differences in their skulls. the carrier more especially the male bird is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids very large external orifices to the nostrils and a wide gape of mouth. the shortfaced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch and the common tumbler has the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock and tumbling in the air head over heels. the runt is a bird of great size with long massive beak and large feet some of the subbreeds of runts have very long necks others very long wings and tails others singularly short tails. the barb is allied to the carrier but instead of a very long beak has a very short and very broad one. the pouter has a much elongated body wings and legs and its enormously developed crop which it glories in inflating may well excite astonishment and even laughter. the turbit has a very short and conical beak with a line of reversed feathers down the breast and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the oesophagus. the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood and it has proportionally to its size much elongated wing and tail feathers. the trumpeter and laugher as their names express utter a very different coo from the other breeds. the fantail has thirty or even forty tailfeathers instead of twelve or fourteen the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family and these feathers are kept expanded and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch the oilgland is quite aborted. several other less distinct breeds might have been specified. in the skeletons of the several breeds the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. the shape as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw varies in a highly remarkable manner. the number of the caudal and sacral vertebr vary as does the number of the ribs together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes. the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. the proportional width of the gape of mouth the proportional length of the eyelids of the orifice of the nostrils of the tongue not always in strict correlation with the length of beak the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus the development and abortion of the oilgland the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body the relative length of leg and of the feet the number of scutell on the toes the development of skin between the toes are all points of structure which are variable. the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched. the shape and size of the eggs vary. the manner of flight differs remarkably as does in some breeds the voice and disposition. lastly in certain breeds the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other. altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen which if shown to an ornithologist and he were told that they were wild birds would certainly i think be ranked by him as welldefined species. moreover i do not believe that any ornithologist would place touch the oilgland is quite aborted. several other less distinct breeds might have been specified. the english carrier the shortfaced tumbler the runt the barb pouter and fantail in the same genus more especially as in each of these breeds several trulyinherited subbreeds or species as he might have called them could be shown him. great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct namely that all have descended from the rockpigeon columba livia including under this term several geographical races or subspecies which differ from each other in the most trifling respects. as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases i will here briefly give them. if the several breeds are not varieties and have not proceeded from the rockpigeon they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number how for instance could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parentstocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rockpigeons that is not breeding or willingly perching on trees. but besides c. livia with its geographical subspecies only two or three other species of rockpigeons are known and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated and yet be unknown to ornithologists and this considering their size habits and remarkable characters seems very improbable or they must have become extinct in the wild state. but birds breeding on precipices and good fliers are unlikely to be exterminated and the common rockpigeon which has the same habits with the domestic breeds has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets or on the shores of the mediterranean. hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rockpigeon seems to me a very rash assumption. moreover the several abovenamed domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world and therefore some of them must have been carried back again into their native country but not one has ever become wild or feral though the dovecotpigeon which is the rockpigeon in a very slightly altered state has become feral in several places. again all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by halfcivilized man as to be quite prolific under confinement. an argument as it seems to me of great weight and applicable in several other cases is that the abovespecified breeds though agreeing generally in constitution habits voice colouring and in most parts of their structure with the wild rockpigeon yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbid for a beak like that of the english carrier or that of the shortfaced tumbler or barb for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin for a crop like that of the pouter for tailfeathers like those of the fantail. hence it must be assumed not only that halfcivilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species and further that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. so many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.  some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration. the rockpigeon is of a slatyblue and has a white rump the indian subspecies c. intermedia of strickland having it bluish the tail has a terminal dark bar with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white the wings have two black bars some semidomestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have besides the two black bars the wings chequered with black. these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family. now in every one of the domestic breeds taking thoroughly wellbred birds all the above marks even to the white edging of the outer tailfeathers sometimes concur perfectly developed. moreover when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed neither of which is blue or has any of the abovespecified marks the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters for instance i crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs and they produced mottled brown and black birds these i again crossed together and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour with the white rump double black wingbar and barred and whiteedged tailfeathers as any wild rockpigeon! we can understand these facts on the wellknown principle of reversion to ancestral characters if all the domestic breeds have descended from the rockpigeon. but if we deny this we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. either firstly that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rockpigeon although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. or secondly that each breed even the purest has within a dozen or at most within a score of generations been crossed by the rockpigeon i say within a dozen or twenty generations for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor removed by a greater number of generations. in a breed which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed the tendency to reversion to any character derived from such cross will naturally become less and less as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a character which has been lost during some former generation this tendency for all that we can see to the contrary may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. these two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance. lastly the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of pigeons are perfectly fertile. i can state this from my own observations purposely made on the most distinct breeds. now it is difficult perhaps impossible to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals clearly distinct being themselves perfectly fertile. some authors believe that longcontinued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility from the history of the dog i think there is some probability in this hypothesis if applied to species closely related together though it is unsupported by a single experiment. but to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that species aboriginally as distinct as carriers tumblers pouters and fantails now are should yield offspring perfectly fertile inter se seems to me rash in the extreme. from these several reasons namely the improbability of man having formerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state and their becoming nowhere feral these species having very abnormal characters in certain respects as compared with all other columbid though so like in most other respects to the rockpigeon the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds both when kept pure and when crossed the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertilefrom these several reasons taken together i can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the columba livia with its geographical subspecies. in favour of this view i may add firstly that c. livia or the rockpigeon has been found capable of domestication in europe and in india and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds. secondly although an english carrier or shortfaced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rockpigeon yet by comparing the several subbreeds of these breeds more especially those brought from distant countries we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure. thirdly those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier the shortness of that of the tumbler and the number of tailfeathers in the fantail are in each breed eminently variable and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection. fourthly pigeons have been watched and tended with the utmost care and loved by many people. they have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth aegyptian dynasty about 3000 b.c. as was pointed out to me by professor lepsius but mr. birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. in the time of the romans as we hear from pliny immense prices were given for pigeons nay they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race. pigeons were much valued by akber khan in india about the year 1600 never less than 20000 pigeons were taken with the court. the monarchs of iran and turan sent him some very rare birds and continues the courtly historian his majesty by crossing the breeds which method was never practised before has improved them astonishingly. about this same period the dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old romans. the paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone will be obvious when we treat of selection. we shall then also see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character. it is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary. i have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some yet quite insufficient length because when i first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds knowing well how true they bred i felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common parent as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches or other large groups of birds in nature. one circumstance has struck me much namely that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants with whom i have ever conversed or whose treatises i have read are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species. ask as i have asked a celebrated raiser of hereford cattle whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns and he will laugh you to scorn. i have never met a pigeon or poultry or duck or rabbit fancier who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species. van mons in his treatise on pears and apples shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts for instance a ribstonpippin or codlinapple could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. innumerable other examples could be given. the explanation i think is simple from longcontinued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races and though they well know that each race varies slightly for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences yet they ignore all general arguments and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations. may not those naturalists who knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the same parentsmay they not learn a lesson of caution when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species? selection.let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced either from one or from several allied species. some little effect may perhaps be attributed to the direct action of the external conditions of life and some little to habit but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and race horse a greyhound and bloodhound a carrier and tumbler pigeon. one of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation not indeed to the animals or plants own good but to mans use or fancy. some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly or by one step many botanists for instance believe that the fullers teazle with its hooks which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance is only a variety of the wild dipsacus and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. so it has probably been with the turnspit dog and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep. but when we compare the drayhorse and racehorse the dromedary and camel the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture with the wool of one breed good for one purpose and that of another breed for another purpose when we compare the many breeds of dogs each good for man in very different ways when we compare the gamecock so pertinacious in battle with other breeds so little quarrelsome with everlasting layers which never desire to sit and with the bantam so small and elegant when we compare the host of agricultural culinary orchard and flowergarden races of plants most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes or so beautiful in his eyes we must i think look further than to mere variability. we cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them indeed in several cases we know that this has not been their history. the key is mans power of accumulative selection nature gives successive variations man adds them up in certain directions useful to him. in this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds. the great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. it is certain that several of our eminent breeders have even within a single lifetime modified to a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep. in order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject and to inspect the animals. breeders habitually speak of an animals organisation as something quite plastic which they can model almost as they please. if i had space i could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities. youatt who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual and who was himself a very good judge of an animal speaks of the principle of selection as that which enables the agriculturist not only to modify the character of his flock but to change it altogether. it is the magicians wand by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases. lord somerville speaking of what breeders have done for sheep saysit would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself and then had given it existence. that most skilful breeder sir john sebright used to say with respect to pigeons that he would produce any given feather in three years but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak. in saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised that men follow it as a trade the sheep are placed on a table and are studied like a picture by a connoisseur this is done three times at intervals of months and the sheep are each time marked and classed so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding. what english breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree and these have now been exported to almost every quarter of the world. the improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice except sometimes amongst closely allied subbreeds. and when a cross has been made the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. if selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from it the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction during successive generations of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eyedifferences which i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. if gifted with these qualities and he studies his subject for years and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance he will succeed and may make great improvements if he wants any of these qualities he will assuredly fail. few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeonfancier. the same principles are followed by horticulturists but the variations are here often more abrupt. no one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. we have proofs that this is not so in some cases in which exact records have been kept thus to give a very trifling instance the steadilyincreasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted. we see an astonishing improvement in many florists flowers when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. when a race of plants is once pretty well established the seedraisers do not pick out the best plants but merely go over their seedbeds and pull up the rogues as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. with animals this kind of selection is in fact also followed for hardly any one is so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed. in regard to plants there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selectionnamely by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flowergarden the diversity of leaves pods or tubers or whatever part is valued in the kitchengarden in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. see how different the leaves of the cabbage are and how extremely alike the flowers how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are and how alike the leaves how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size colour shape and hairiness and yet the flowers present very slight differences. it is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points this is hardly ever perhaps never the case. the laws of correlation of growth the importance of which should never be overlooked will ensure some differences but as a general rule i cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations either in the leaves the flowers or the fruit will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters. it may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than threequarters of a century it has certainly been more attended to of late years and many treatises have been published on the subject and the result i may add has been in a corresponding degree rapid and important. but it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery. i could give several references to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high antiquity. in rude and barbarous periods of english history choice animals were often imported and laws were passed to prevent their exportation the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered and this may be compared to the roguing of plants by nurserymen. the principle of selection i find distinctly given in an ancient chinese encyclopdia. explicit rules are laid down by some of the roman classical writers. from passages in genesis it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to. savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals to improve the breed and they formerly did so as is attested by passages in pliny. the savages in south africa match their draught cattle by colour as do some of the esquimaux their teams of dogs. livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the interior of africa who have not associated with europeans. some of these facts do not show actual selection but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times and is now attended to by the lowest savages. it would indeed have been a strange fact had attention not been paid to breeding for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious. at the present time eminent breeders try by methodical selection with a distinct object in view to make a new strain or subbreed superior to anything existing in the country. but for our purpose a kind of selection which may be called unconscious and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals is more important. thus a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed. nevertheless i cannot doubt that this process continued during centuries would improve and modify any breed in the same way as bakewell collins etc. by this very same process only carried on more methodically did greatly modify even during their own lifetimes the forms and qualities of their cattle. slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago which might serve for comparison. in some cases however unchanged or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts where the breed has been less improved. there is reason to believe that king charless spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel and has probably been slowly altered from it. it is known that the english pointer has been greatly changed within the last century and in this case the change has it is believed been chiefly effected by crosses with the foxhound but what concerns us is that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually and yet so effectually that though the old spanish pointer certainly came from spain mr. borrow has not seen as i am informed by him any native dog in spain like our pointer. by a similar process of selection and by careful training the whole body of english racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent arab stock so that the latter by the regulations for the goodwood races are favoured in the weights they carry. lord spencer and others have shown how the cattle of england have increased in weight and in early maturity compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. by comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in britain india and persia we can i think clearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed and come to differ so greatly from the rockpigeon. youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection which may be considered as unconsciously followed in so far that the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have produced the result which ensuednamely the production of two distinct strains. the two flocks of leicester sheep kept by mr. buckley and mr. burgess as mr. youatt remarks have been purely bred from the original stock of mr. bakewell for upwards of fifty years. there is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of mr. bakewells flock and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties. if there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals yet any one animal particularly useful to them for any special purpose would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents to which savages are so liable and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on. we see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of tierra del fuego by their killing and devouring their old women in times of dearth as of less value than their dogs. in plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional preservation of the best individuals whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease rose pelargonium dahlia and other plants when compared with the older varieties or with their parentstocks. no one would ever expect to get a firstrate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. no one would expect to raise a firstrate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild if it had come from a gardenstock. the pear though cultivated in classical times appears from plinys description to have been a fruit of very inferior quality. i have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials but the art i cannot doubt has been simple and as far as the final result is concerned has been followed almost unconsciously. it has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety sowing its seeds and when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear selecting it and so onwards. but the gardeners of the classical period who cultivated the best pear they could procure never thought what splendid fruit we should eat though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find. a large amount of change in our cultivated plants thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated explains as i believe the wellknown fact that in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise and therefore do not know the wild parentstocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens. if it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man we can understand how it is that neither australia the cape of good hope nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man has afforded us a single plant worth culture. it is not that these countries so rich in species do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised. in regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food at least during certain seasons. and in two countries very differently circumstanced individuals of the same species having slightly different constitutions or structure would often succeed better in the one country than in the other and thus by a process of natural selection as will hereafter be more fully explained two subbreeds might be formed. this perhaps partly explains what has been remarked by some authors namely that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species than the varieties kept in civilised countries. on the view here given of the allimportant part which selection by man has played it becomes at once obvious how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to mans wants or fancies. we can i think further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. man can hardly select or only with much difficulty any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. he can never act by selection excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. no man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared the more likely it would be to catch his attention. but to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail is i have no doubt in most cases utterly incorrect. the man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through longcontinued partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tailfeathers somewhat expanded like the present java fantail or like individuals of other and distinct breeds in which as many as seventeen tailfeathers have been counted. perhaps the first pouterpigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagusa habit which is disregarded by all fanciers as it is not one of the points of the breed. nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fanciers eye he perceives extremely small differences and it is in human nature to value any novelty however slight in ones own possession. nor must the value which would formerly be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species be judged of by the value which would now be set on them after several breeds have once fairly been established. many slight differences might and indeed do now arise amongst pigeons which are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed. the common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties hence the thoulouse and the common breed which differ only in colour that most fleeting of characters have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultryshows. i think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticednamely that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds. but in fact a breed like a dialect of a language can hardly be said to have had a definite origin. a man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them and the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. but as yet they will hardly have a distinct name and from being only slightly valued their history will be disregarded. when further improved by the same slow and gradual process they will spread more widely and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable and will then probably first receive a provincial name. in semicivilised countries with little free communication the spreading and knowledge of any new subbreed will be a slow process. as soon as the points of value of the new subbreed are once fully acknowledged the principle as i have called it of unconscious selection will always tendperhaps more at one period than at another as the breed rises or falls in fashionperhaps more in one district than in another according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitantsslowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed whatever they may be. but the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow varying and insensible changes. i must now say a few words on the circumstances favourable or the reverse to mans power of selection. a high degree of variability is obviously favourable as freely giving the materials for selection to work on not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient with extreme care to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction. but as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. on this principle marshall has remarked with respect to the sheep of parts of yorkshire that as they generally belong to poor people and are mostly in small lots they never can be improved. on the other hand nurserymen from raising large stocks of the same plants are generally far more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. the keeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of life so as to breed freely in that country. when the individuals of any species are scanty all the individuals whatever their quality may be will generally be allowed to breed and this will effectually prevent selection. but probably the most important point of all is that the animal or plant should be so highly useful to man or so much valued by him that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the qualities or structure of each individual. unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. i have seen it gravely remarked that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this plant. no doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated but the slight varieties had been neglected. as soon however as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger earlier or better fruit and raised seedlings from them and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them then there appeared aided by some crossing with distinct species those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during the last thirty or forty years. in the case of animals with separate sexes facility in preventing crosses is an important element of success in the formation of new racesat least in a country which is already stocked with other races. in this respect enclosure of the land plays a part. wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species. pigeons can be mated for life and this is a great convenience to the fancier for thus many races may be kept true though mingled in the same aviary and this circumstance must have largely favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds. pigeons i may add can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate and inferior birds may be freely rejected as when killed they serve for food. on the other hand cats from their nocturnal rambling habits cannot be matched and although so much valued by women and children we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country often from islands. although i do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat the donkey peacock goose etc. may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play in cats from the difficulty in pairing them in donkeys from only a few being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding in peacocks from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept in geese from being valuable only for two purposes food and feathers and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds.  to sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants. i believe that the conditions of life from their action on the reproductive system are so far of the highest importance as causing variability. i do not believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency under all circumstances with all organic beings as some authors have thought. the effects of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance and of reversion. variability is governed by many unknown laws more especially by that of correlation of growth. something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life. something must be attributed to use and disuse. the final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. in some cases i do not doubt that the intercrossing of species aboriginally distinct has played an important part in the origin of our domestic productions. when in any country several domestic breeds have once been established their occasional intercrossing with the aid of selection has no doubt largely aided in the formation of new subbreeds but the importance of the crossing of varieties has i believe been greatly exaggerated both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed. in plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings buds etc. the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties is immense for the cultivator here quite disregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels and the frequent sterility of hybrids but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us for their endurance is only temporary. over all these causes of change i am convinced that the accumulative action of selection whether applied methodically and more quickly or unconsciously and more slowly but more efficiently is by far the predominant power.   variation under nature.  variability. individual differences. doubtful species. wide ranging much diffused and common species vary most. species of the larger genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera. many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being very closely but unequally related to each other and in having restricted ranges. organic beings in a state of nature we must briefly discuss whether these latter are subject to any variation. to treat this subject at all properly a long catalogue of dry facts should be given but these i shall reserve for my future work. nor shall i here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species. no one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. the term variety is almost equally difficult to define but here community of descent is almost universally implied though it can rarely be proved. we have also what are called monstrosities but they graduate into varieties. by a monstrosity i presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure in one part either injurious to or not useful to the species and not generally propagated. some authors use the term variation in a technical sense as implying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life and variations in this sense are supposed not to be inherited but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the baltic or dwarfed plants on alpine summits or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards would not in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations? and in this case i presume that the form would be called a variety. again we have many slight differences which may be called individual differences such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from the same parents or which may be presumed to have thus arisen from being frequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality. no one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the very same mould. these individual differences are highly important for us as they afford materials for natural selection to accumulate in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given direction individual differences in his domesticated productions. these individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant parts but i could show by a long catalogue of facts that parts which must be called important whether viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species. i am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability even in important parts of structure which he could collect on good authority as i have collected during a course of years. it should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important characters and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs and compare them in many specimens of the same species. i should never have expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species i should have expected that changes of this nature could have been effected only by slow degrees yet quite recently mr. lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in coccus which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree. this philosophical naturalist i may add has also quite recently shown that the muscles in the larv of certain insects are very far from uniform. authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary for these same authors practically rank that character as important as some few naturalists have honestly confessed which does not vary and under this point of view no instance of an important part varying will ever be found but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given. there is one point connected with individual differences which seems to me extremely perplexing i refer to those genera which have sometimes been called protean or polymorphic in which the species present an inordinate amount of variation and hardly two naturalists can agree which forms to rank as species and which as varieties. we may instance rubus rosa and hieracium amongst plants several genera of insects and several genera of brachiopod shells. in most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite characters. genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be with some few exceptions polymorphic in other countries and likewise judging from brachiopod shells at former periods of time. these facts seem to be very perplexing for they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life. i am inclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection as hereafter will be explained.  those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of species but which are so closely similar to some other forms or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species are in several respects the most important for us. we have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closelyallied forms have permanently retained their characters in their own country for a long time for as long as far as we know as have good and true species. practically when a naturalist can unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters he treats the one as a variety of the other ranking the most common but sometimes the one first described as the species and the other as the variety. but cases of great difficulty which i will not here enumerate sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another even when they are closely connected by intermediate links nor will the commonlyassumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always remove the difficulty. in very many cases however one form is ranked as a variety of another not because the intermediate links have actually been found but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist or may formerly have existed and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened. hence in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow. we must however in many cases decide by a majority of naturalists for few wellmarked and wellknown varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges.  that varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be disputed. compare the several floras of great britain of france or of the united states drawn up by different botanists and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species and by another as mere varieties. mr. h. c. watson to whom i lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds has marked for me 182 british plants which are generally considered as varieties but which have all been ranked by botanists as species and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera. under genera including the most polymorphic forms mr. babington gives 251 species whereas mr. bentham gives only 112a difference of 139 doubtful forms! amongst animals which unite for each birth and which are highly locomotive doubtful forms ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety can rarely be found within the same country but are common in separated areas. how many of those birds and insects in north america and europe which differ very slightly from each other have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species and by another as varieties or as they are often called as geographical races! many years ago when comparing and seeing others compare the birds from the separate islands of the galapagos archipelago both one with another and with those from the american mainland i was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties. on the islets of the little madeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties in mr. wollastons admirable work but which it cannot be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists. even ireland has a few animals now generally regarded as varieties but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists. several most experienced ornithologists consider our british red grouse as only a stronglymarked race of a norwegian species whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to great britain. a wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct species but what distance it has been well asked will suffice? if that between america and europe is ample will that between the continent and the azores or madeira or the canaries or ireland be sufficient? it must be admitted that many forms considered by highlycompetent judges as varieties have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked by other highlycompetent judges as good and true species. but to discuss whether they are rightly called species or varieties before any definition of these terms has been generally accepted is vainly to beat the air. many of the cases of stronglymarked varieties or doubtful species well deserve consideration for several interesting lines of argument from geographical distribution analogical variation hybridism etc. have been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank. i will here give only a single instancethe wellknown one of the primrose and cowslip or primula veris and elatior. these plants differ considerably in appearance they have a different flavour and emit a different odour they flower at slightly different periods they grow in somewhat different stations they ascend mountains to different heights they have different geographical ranges and lastly according to very numerous experiments made during several years by that most careful observer grtner they can be crossed only with much difficulty. we could hardly wish for better evidence of the two forms being specifically distinct. on the other hand they are united by many intermediate links and it is very doubtful whether these links are hybrids and there is as it seems to me an overwhelming amount of experimental evidence showing that they descend from common parents and consequently must be ranked as varieties. close investigation in most cases will bring naturalists to an agreement how to rank doubtful forms. yet it must be confessed that it is in the bestknown countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful value. i have been struck with the fact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man or from any cause closely attract his attention varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded. these varieties moreover will be often ranked by some authors as species. look at the common oak how closely it has been studied yet a german author makes more than a dozen species out of forms which are very generally considered as varieties and in this country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties. when a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences to consider as specific and what as varieties for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is subject and this shows at least how very generally there is some variation. but if he confine his attention to one class within one country he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms. his general tendency will be to make many species for he will become impressed just like the pigeon or poultryfancier before alluded to with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually studying and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and in other countries by which to correct his first impressions. as he extends the range of his observations he will meet with more cases of difficulty for he will encounter a greater number of closelyallied forms. but if his observations be widely extended he will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which species but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variationand the truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists. when moreover he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous in which case he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy and his difficulties will rise to a climax. certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and subspeciesthat is the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to but do not quite arrive at the rank of species or again between subspecies and wellmarked varieties or between lesser varieties and individual differences. these differences blend into each other in an insensible series and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage. hence i look at individual differences though of small interest to the systematist as of high importance for us as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history. and i look at varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent as steps leading to more strongly marked and more permanent varieties and at these latter as leading to subspecies and to species. the passage from one stage of difference to another and higher stage may be in some cases due merely to the longcontinued action of different physical conditions in two different regions but i have not much faith in this view and i attribute the passage of a variety from a state in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it differs more to the action of natural selection in accumulating as will hereafter be more fully explained differences of structure in certain definite directions. hence i believe a wellmarked variety may be justly called an incipient species but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this work. it need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily attain the rank of species. they may whilst in this incipient state become extinct or they may endure as varieties for very long periods as has been shown to be the case by mr. wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil landshells in madeira. if a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species it would then rank as the species and the species as the variety or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent species or both might coexist and both rank as independent species. but we shall hereafter have to return to this subject. from these remarks it will be seen that i look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. the term variety again in comparison with mere individual differences is also applied arbitrarily and for mere convenience sake.  guided by theoretical considerations i thought that some interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the species which vary most by tabulating all the varieties in several wellworked floras. at first this seemed a simple task but mr. h. c. watson to whom i am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on this subject soon convinced me that there were many difficulties as did subsequently dr. hooker even in stronger terms. i shall reserve for my future work the discussion of these difficulties and the tables themselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species. dr. hooker permits me to add that after having carefully read my manuscript and examined the tables he thinks that the following statements are fairly well established. the whole subject however treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity is rather perplexing and allusions cannot be avoided to the struggle for existence divergence of character and other questions hereafter to be discussed. alph. de candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide ranges generally present varieties and this might have been expected as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions and as they come into competition which as we shall hereafter see is a far more important circumstance with different sets of organic beings. but my tables further show that in any limited country the species which are most common that is abound most in individuals and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country and this is a different consideration from wide range and to a certain extent from commonness often give rise to varieties sufficiently wellmarked to have been recorded in botanical works. hence it is the most flourishing or as they may be called the dominant speciesthose which range widely over the world are the most diffused in their own country and are the most numerous in individualswhich oftenest produce wellmarked varieties or as i consider them incipient species. and this perhaps might have been anticipated for as varieties in order to become in any degree permanent necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country the species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield offspring which though in some slight degree modified will still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots. if the plants inhabiting a country and described in any flora be divided into two equal masses all those in the larger genera being placed on one side and all those in the smaller genera on the other side a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will be found on the side of the larger genera. this again might have been anticipated for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus and consequently we might have expected to have found in the larger genera or those including many species a large proportional number of dominant species. but so many causes tend to obscure this result that i am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of the larger genera. i will here allude to only two causes of obscurity. freshwater and saltloving plants have generally very wide ranges and are much diffused but this seems to be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them and has little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong. again plants low in the scale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale and here again there is no close relation to the size of the genera. the cause of lowlyorganised plants ranging widely will be discussed in from looking at species as only stronglymarked and welldefined varieties i was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties than the species of the smaller genera for wherever many closely related species i.e. species of the same genus have been formed many varieties or incipient species ought as a general rule to be now forming. where many large trees grow we expect to find saplings. where many species of a genus have been formed through variation circumstances have been favourable for variation and hence we might expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to variation. on the other hand if we look at each species as a special act of creation there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species than in one having few. to test the truth of this anticipation i have arranged the plants of twelve countries and the coleopterous insects of two districts into two nearly equal masses the species of the larger genera on one side and those of the smaller genera on the other side and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera present varieties than on the side of the smaller genera. moreover the species of the large genera which present any varieties invariably present a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the small genera. both these results follow when another division is made and when all the smallest genera with from only one to four species are absolutely excluded from the tables. these facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed or where if we may use the expression the manufactory of species has been active we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one. and this certainly is the case if varieties be looked at as incipient species for my tables clearly show as a general rule that wherever many species of a genus have been formed the species of that genus present a number of varieties that is of incipient species beyond the average. it is not that all large genera are now varying much and are thus increasing in the number of their species or that no small genera are now varying and increasing for if this had been so it would have been fatal to my theory inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size and that large genera have often come to their maxima declined and disappeared. all that we want to show is that where many species of a genus have been formed on an average many are still forming and this holds good. there are other relations between the species of large genera and their recorded varieties which deserve notice. we have seen that there is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and wellmarked varieties and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been found between doubtful forms naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by the amount of difference between them judging by analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species. hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties. now fries has remarked in regard to plants and westwood in regard to insects that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small. i have endeavoured to test this numerically by averages and as far as my imperfect results go they always confirm the view. i have also consulted some sagacious and most experienced observers and after deliberation they concur in this view. in this respect therefore the species of the larger genera resemble varieties more than do the species of the smaller genera. or the case may be put in another way and it may be said that in the larger genera in which a number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing many of the species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference. moreover the species of the large genera are related to each other in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other. no naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct from each other they may generally be divided into subgenera or sections or lesser groups. as fries has well remarked little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around certain other species. and what are varieties but groups of forms unequally related to each other and clustered round certain formsthat is round their parentspecies? undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference between varieties and species namely that the amount of difference between varieties when compared with each other or with their parentspecies is much less than that between the species of the same genus. but when we come to discuss the principle as i call it of divergence of character we shall see how this may be explained and how the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the greater differences between species. there is one other point which seems to me worth notice. varieties generally have much restricted ranges this statement is indeed scarcely more than a truism for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of its supposed parentspecies their denominations ought to be reversed. but there is also reason to believe that those species which are very closely allied to other species and in so far resemble varieties often have much restricted ranges. for instance mr. h. c. watson has marked for me in the wellsifted london catalogue of plants 4th edition 63 plants which are therein ranked as species but which he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value these 63 reputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which mr. watson has divided great britain. now in this same catalogue 53 acknowledged varieties are recorded and these range over 7.7 provinces whereas the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3 provinces. so that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range as have those very closely allied forms marked for me by mr. watson as doubtful species but which are almost universally ranked by british botanists as good and true species. finally then varieties have the same general characters as species for they cannot be distinguished from speciesexcept firstly by the discovery of intermediate linking forms and the occurrence of such links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect and except secondly by a certain amount of difference for two forms if differing very little are generally ranked as varieties notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been discovered but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite. in genera having more than the average number of species in any country the species of these genera have more than the average number of varieties. in large genera the species are apt to be closely but unequally allied together forming little clusters round certain species. species very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges. in all these several respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties. and we can clearly understand these analogies if species have once existed as varieties and have thus originated whereas these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has been independently created. we have also seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant species of the larger genera which on an average vary most and varieties as we shall hereafter see tend to become converted into new and distinct species. the larger genera thus tend to become larger and throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants. but by steps hereafter to be explained the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera. and thus the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups.   struggle for existence.  bears on natural selection. the term used in a wide sense. geometrical powers of increase. rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants. nature of the checks to increase. competition universal. effects of climate. protection from the number of individuals. complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature. struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties of the same species often severe between species of the same genus. the relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations.  preliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability indeed i am not aware that this has ever been disputed. it is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or subspecies or varieties what rank for instance the two or three hundred doubtful forms of british plants are entitled to hold if the existence of any wellmarked varieties be admitted. but the mere existence of individual variability and of some few wellmarked varieties though necessary as the foundation for the work helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature. how have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part and to the conditions of life and of one distinct organic being to another being been perfected? we see these beautiful coadaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze in short we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world. again it may be asked how is it that varieties which i have called incipient species become ultimately converted into good and distinct species which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species? how do those groups of species which constitute what are called distinct genera and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus arise? all these results as we shall more fully see in the next struggle for life any variation however slight and from whatever cause proceeding if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature will tend to the preservation of that individual and will generally be inherited by its offspring. the offspring also will thus have a better chance of surviving for of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born but a small number can survive. i have called this principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved by the term of natural selection in order to mark its relation to mans power of selection. we have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results and can adapt organic beings to his own uses through the accumulation of slight but useful variations given to him by the hand of nature. but natural selection as we shall hereafter see is a power incessantly ready for action and is as immeasurably superior to mans feeble efforts as the works of nature are to those of art.  we will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence. in my future work this subject shall be treated as it well deserves at much greater length. the elder de candolle and lyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition. in regard to plants no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than w. herbert dean of manchester evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge. nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life or more difficultat least i have found it sothan constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind i am convinced that the whole economy of nature with every fact on distribution rarity abundance extinction and variation will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. we behold the face of nature bright with gladness we often see superabundance of food we do not see or we forget that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds and are thus constantly destroying life or we forget how largely these songsters or their eggs or their nestlings are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey we do not always bear in mind that though food may be now superabundant it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year. i should premise that i use the term struggle for existence in a large and metaphorical sense including dependence of one being on another and including which is more important not only the life of the individual but success in leaving progeny. two canine animals in a time of dearth may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. but a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. a plant which annually produces a thousand seeds of which on an average only one comes to maturity may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. the missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees but can only in a farfetched sense be said to struggle with these trees for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree it will languish and die. but several seedling missletoes growing close together on the same branch may more truly be said to struggle with each other. as the missletoe is disseminated by birds its existence depends on birds and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruitbearing plants in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. in these several senses which pass into each other i use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence. a struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase. every being which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds must suffer destruction during some period of its life and during some season or occasional year otherwise on the principle of geometrical increase its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product. hence as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive there must in every case be a struggle for existence either one individual with another of the same species or with the individuals of distinct species or with the physical conditions of life. it is the doctrine of malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food and no prudential restraint from marriage. although some species may be now increasing more or less rapidly in numbers all cannot do so for the world would not hold them. there is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. even slowbreeding man has doubled in twentyfive years and at this rate in a few thousand years there would literally not be standing room for his progeny. linnus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seedsand there is no plant so unproductive as thisand their seedlings next year produced two and so on then in twenty years there would be a million plants. the elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals and i have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old and goes on breeding till ninety years old bringing forth three pair of young in this interval if this be so at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants descended from the first pair. but we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations namely the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons. still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world if the statements of the rate of increase of slowbreeding cattle and horses in south america and latterly in australia had not been well authenticated they would have been quite incredible. so it is with plants cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years. several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of la plata clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants have been introduced from europe and there are plants which now range in india as i hear from dr. falconer from cape comorin to the himalaya which have been imported from america since its discovery. in such cases and endless instances could be given no one supposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree. the obvious explanation is that the conditions of life have been very favourable and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed. in such cases the geometrical ratio of increase the result of which never fails to be surprising simply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of naturalised productions in their new homes. in a state of nature almost every plant produces seed and amongst animals there are very few which do not annually pair. hence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio that all would most rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist and that the geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life. our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends i think to mislead us we see no great destruction falling on them and we forget that thousands are annually slaughtered for food and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of. the only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or seeds by the thousand and those which produce extremely few is that the slowbreeders would require a few more years to people under favourable conditions a whole district let it be ever so large. the condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two the fulmar petrel lays but one egg yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. one fly deposits hundreds of eggs and another like the hippobosca a single one but this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. a large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. but the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. if an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young a small number may be produced and yet the average stock be fully kept up but if many eggs or young are destroyed many must be produced or the species will become extinct. it would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree which lived on an average for a thousand years if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place. so that in all cases the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds. in looking at nature it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mindnever to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each generation or at recurrent intervals. lighten any check mitigate the destruction ever so little and the number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount. the face of nature may be compared to a yielding surface with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows sometimes one wedge being struck and then another with greater force. what checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number is most obscure. look at the most vigorous species by as much as it swarms in numbers by so much will its tendency to increase be still further increased. we know not exactly what the checks are in even one single instance. nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head even in regard to mankind so incomparably better known than any other animal. this subject has been ably treated by several authors and i shall in my future work discuss some of the checks at considerable length more especially in regard to the feral animals of south america. here i will make only a few remarks just to recall to the readers mind some of the chief points. eggs or very young animals seem generally to suffer most but this is not invariably the case. with plants there is a vast destruction of seeds but from some observations which i have made i believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants. seedlings also are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies for instance on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide dug and cleared and where there could be no choking from other plants i marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up and out of the 357 no less than 295 were destroyed chiefly by slugs and insects. if turf which has long been mown and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds be let to grow the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous though fully grown plants thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf three feet by four nine species perished from the other species being allowed to grow up freely. the amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to which each can increase but very frequently it is not the obtaining food but the serving as prey to other animals which determines the average numbers of a species. thus there seems to be little doubt that the stock of partridges grouse and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin. if not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in england and at the same time if no vermin were destroyed there would in all probability be less game than at present although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed. on the other hand in some cases as with the elephant and rhinoceros none are destroyed by beasts of prey even the tiger in india most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam. climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought i believe to be the most effective of all checks. i estimated that the winter of 185455 destroyed fourfifths of the birds in my own grounds and this is a tremendous destruction when we remember that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. the action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals whether of the same or of distinct species which subsist on the same kind of food. even when climate for instance extreme cold acts directly it will be the least vigorous or those which have got least food through the advancing winter which will suffer most. when we travel from south to north or from a damp region to a dry we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer and finally disappearing and the change of climate being conspicuous we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. but this is a very false view we forget that each species even where it most abounds is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate they will increase in numbers and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants the other species will decrease. when we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured as in this one being hurt. so it is when we travel northward but in a somewhat lesser degree for the number of species of all kinds and therefore of competitors decreases northwards hence in going northward or in ascending a mountain we far oftener meet with stunted forms due to the directly injurious action of climate than we do in proceeding southwards or in descending a mountain. when we reach the arctic regions or snowcapped summits or absolute deserts the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements. that climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate but which never become naturalised for they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by our native animals.  when a species owing to highly favourable circumstances increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract epidemicsat least this seems generally to occur with our game animalsoften ensue and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. but even some of these socalled epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms which have from some cause possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals been disproportionably favoured and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey. on the other hand in many cases a large stock of individuals of the same species relatively to the numbers of its enemies is absolutely necessary for its preservation. thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and rapeseed etc. in our fields because the seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them nor can the birds though having a superabundance of food at this one season increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed as their numbers are checked during winter but any one who has tried knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden i have in this case lost every single seed. this view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation explains i believe some singular facts in nature such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where they do occur and that of some social plants being social that is abounding in individuals even on the extreme confines of their range. for in such cases we may believe that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist together and thus save each other from utter destruction. i should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing and the ill effects of close interbreeding probably come into play in some of these cases but on this intricate subject i will not here enlarge. many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations between organic beings which have to struggle together in the same country. i will give only a single instance which though a simple one has interested me. in staffordshire on the estate of a relation where i had ample means of investigation there was a large and extremely barren heath which had never been touched by the hand of man but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twentyfive years previously and planted with scotch fir. the change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable more than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another not only the proportional numbers of the heathplants were wholly changed but twelve species of plants not counting grasses and carices flourished in the plantations which could not be found on the heath. the effect on the insects must have been still greater for six insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations which were not to be seen on the heath and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree nothing whatever else having been done with the exception that the land had been enclosed so that cattle could not enter. but how important an element enclosure is i plainly saw near farnham in surrey. here there are extensive heaths with a few clumps of old scotch firs on the distant hilltops within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed and selfsown firs are now springing up in multitudes so close together that all cannot live. when i ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted i was so much surprised at their numbers that i went to several points of view whence i could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath and literally i could not see a single scotch fir except the old planted clumps. but on looking closely between the stems of the heath i found a multitude of seedlings and little trees which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. in one square yard at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps i counted thirtytwo little trees and one of them judging from the rings of growth had during twentysix years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath and had failed. no wonder that as soon as the land was enclosed it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food. here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the scotch fir but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of cattle. perhaps paraguay offers the most curious instance of this for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state and azara and rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in paraguay of a certain fly which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. the increase of these flies numerous as they are must be habitually checked by some means probably by birds. hence if certain insectivorous birds whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey were to increase in paraguay the flies would decreasethen cattle and horses would become feral and this would certainly greatly alter as indeed i have observed in parts of south america the vegetation this again would largely affect the insects and this as we just have seen in staffordshire the insectivorous birds and so onwards in everincreasing circles of complexity. we began this series by insectivorous birds and we have ended with them. not that in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this. battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying success and yet in the longrun the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time though assuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another. nevertheless so profound is our ignorance and so high our presumption that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being and as we do not see the cause we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life! i am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals most remote in the scale of nature are bound together by a web of complex relations. i shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic lobelia fulgens in this part of england is never visited by insects and consequently from its peculiar structure never can set a seed. many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollenmasses and thus to fertilise them. i have also reason to believe that humblebees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease viola tricolor for other bees do not visit this flower. from experiments which i have tried i have found that the visits of bees if not indispensable are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers but humblebees alone visit the common red clover trifolium pratense as other bees cannot reach the nectar. hence i have very little doubt that if the whole genus of humblebees became extinct or very rare in england the heartsease and red clover would become very rare or wholly disappear. the number of humblebees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of fieldmice which destroy their combs and nests and mr. h. newman who has long attended to the habits of humblebees believes that more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over england. now the number of mice is largely dependent as every one knows on the number of cats and mr. newman says near villages and small towns i have found the nests of humblebees more numerous than elsewhere which i attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice. hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine through the intervention first of mice and then of bees the frequency of certain flowers in that district! in the case of every species many different checks acting at different periods of life and during different seasons or years probably come into play some one check or some few being generally the most potent but all concurring in determining the average number or even the existence of the species. in some cases it can be shown that widelydifferent checks act on the same species in different districts. when we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. but how false a view is this! every one has heard that when an american forest is cut down a very different vegetation springs up but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient indian mounds in the southern united states display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests. what a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand what war between insect and insectbetween insects snails and other animals with birds and beasts of preyall striving to increase and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! throw up a handful of feathers and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined in the course of centuries the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old indian ruins! the dependency of one organic being on another as of a parasite on its prey lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. this is often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence as in the case of locusts and grassfeeding quadrupeds. but the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species for they frequent the same districts require the same food and are exposed to the same dangers. in the case of varieties of the same species the struggle will generally be almost equally severe and we sometimes see the contest soon decided for instance if several varieties of wheat be sown together and the mixed seed be resown some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate or are naturally the most fertile will beat the others and so yield more seed and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other varieties. to keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweetpeas they must be each year harvested separately and the seed then mixed in due proportion otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear. so again with the varieties of sheep it has been asserted that certain mountainvarieties will starve out other mountainvarieties so that they cannot be kept together. the same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech. it may even be doubted whether the varieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength habits and constitution that the original proportions of a mixed stock could be kept up for half a dozen generations if they were allowed to struggle together like beings in a state of nature and if the seed or young were not annually sorted. as species of the same genus have usually though by no means invariably some similarity in habits and constitution and always in structure the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus when they come into competition with each other than between species of distinct genera. we see this in the recent extension over parts of the united states of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species. the recent increase of the misselthrush in parts of scotland has caused the decrease of the songthrush. how frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates! in russia the small asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener. one species of charlock will supplant another and so in other cases. we can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.  a corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks namely that the structure of every organic being is related in the most essential yet often hidden manner to that of all other organic beings with which it comes into competition for food or residence or from which it has to escape or on which it preys. this is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger and in that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tigers body. but in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion and in the flattened and fringed legs of the waterbeetle the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water. yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by other plants so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. in the waterbeetle the structure of its legs so well adapted for diving allows it to compete with other aquatic insects to hunt for its own prey and to escape serving as prey to other animals. the store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. but from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds as peas and beans when sown in the midst of long grass i suspect that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around. look at a plant in the midst of its range why does it not double or quadruple its numbers? we know that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold dampness or dryness for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder damper or drier districts. in this case we can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in number we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors or over the animals which preyed on it. on the confines of its geographical range a change of constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant but we have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone. not until we reach the extreme confines of life in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert will competition cease. the land may be extremely cold or dry yet there will be competition between some few species or between the individuals of the same species for the warmest or dampest spots. hence also we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new competitors though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home yet the conditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner. if we wished to increase its average numbers in its new home we should have to modify it in a different way to what we should have done in its native country for we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies. it is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another. probably in no single instance should we know what to do so as to succeed. it will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings a conviction as necessary as it seems to be difficult to acquire. all that we can do is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio that each at some period of its life during some season of the year during each generation or at intervals has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction. when we reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not incessant that no fear is felt that death is generally prompt and that the vigorous the healthy and the happy survive and multiply.   natural selection.  natural selection its power compared with mans selection its power on characters of trifling importance its power at all ages and on both sexes.

last which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man apply in nature? i think we shall see that it can act most effectually. let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions and in a lesser degree those under nature vary and how strong the hereditary tendency is. under domestication it may be truly said that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. let it be borne in mind how infinitely complex and closefitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life. can it then be thought improbable seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations? if such do occur can we doubt remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive that individuals having any advantage however slight over others would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? on the other hand we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. this preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations i call natural selection. variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection and would be left a fluctuating element as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic. we shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change for instance of climate. the proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change and some species might become extinct. we may conclude from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants independently of the change of climate itself would most seriously affect many of the others. if the country were open on its borders new forms would certainly immigrate and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. but in the case of an island or of a country partly surrounded by barriers into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified for had the area been open to immigration these same places would have been seized on by intruders. in such case every slight modification which in the course of ages chanced to arise and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species by better adapting them to their altered conditions would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. change in the conditions of life by specially acting on the reproductive system causes or increases variability and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring and unless profitable variations do occur natural selection can do nothing. not that as i believe any extreme amount of variability is necessary as man can certainly produce great results by adding up in any given direction mere individual differences so could nature but far more easily from having incomparably longer time at her disposal. nor do i believe that any great physical change as of climate or any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration is actually necessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants. for as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage. no country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live that none of them could anyhow be improved for in all countries the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land. and as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage so as to have better resisted such intruders. as man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection what may not nature effect? man can act only on external and visible characters nature cares nothing for appearances except in so far as they may be useful to any being. she can act on every internal organ on every shade of constitutional difference on the whole machinery of life. man selects only for his own good nature only for that of the being which she tends. every selected character is fully exercised by her and the being is placed under wellsuited conditions of life. man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food he does not exercise a longbacked or longlegged quadruped in any peculiar manner he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate. he does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females. he does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals but protects during each varying season as far as lies in his power all his productions. he often begins his selection by some halfmonstrous form or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye or to be plainly useful to him. under nature the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the nicelybalanced scale in the struggle for life and so be preserved. how fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. can we wonder then that natures productions should be far truer in character than mans productions that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship? it may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising throughout the world every variation even the slightest rejecting that which is bad preserving and adding up all that is good silently and insensibly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. we see nothing of these slow changes in progress until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were. although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being yet characters and structures which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance may thus be acted on. when we see leafeating insects green and barkfeeders mottledgrey the alpine ptarmigan white in winter the redgrouse the colour of heather and the blackgrouse that of peaty earth we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. grouse if not destroyed at some period of their lives would increase in countless numbers they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey and hawks are guided by eyesight to their preyso much so that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons as being the most liable to destruction. hence i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse and in keeping that colour when once acquired true and constant. nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black. in plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist downing that in the united states smoothskinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle a curculio than those with down that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums whereas another disease attacks yellowfleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh. if with all the aids of art these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties assuredly in a state of nature where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies such differences would effectually settle which variety whether a smooth or downy a yellow or purple fleshed fruit should succeed. in looking at many small points of difference between species which as far as our ignorance permits us to judge seem to be quite unimportant we must not forget that climate food etc. probably produce some slight and direct effect. it is however far more necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth which when one part of the organisation is modified through variation and the modifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of the being will cause other modifications often of the most unexpected nature. as we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any particular period of life tend to reappear in the offspring at the same periodfor instance in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm in the eggs of poultry and in the colour of the down of their chickens in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adultso in a state of nature natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age by the accumulation of profitable variations at that age and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. if it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind i can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection than in the cottonplanter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cottontrees. natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies wholly different from those which concern the mature insect. these modifications will no doubt affect through the laws of correlation the structure of the adult and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours and which never feed a large part of their structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their larv. so conversely modifications in the adult will probably often affect the structure of the larva but in all cases natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of life shall not be in the least degree injurious for if they became so they would cause the extinction of the species. natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to the parent and of the parent in relation to the young. in social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the community if each in consequence profits by the selected change. what natural selection cannot do is to modify the structure of one species without giving it any advantage for the good of another species and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history i cannot find one case which will bear investigation. a structure used only once in an animals whole life if of high importance to it might be modified to any extent by natural selection for instance the great jaws possessed by certain insects and used exclusively for opening the cocoonor the hard tip to the beak of nestling birds used for breaking the egg. it has been asserted that of the best shortbeaked tumblerpigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching. now if nature had to make the beak of a fullgrown pigeon very short for the birds own advantage the process of modification would be very slow and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds within the egg which had the most powerful and hardest beaks for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish or more delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure. sexual selection.inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex the same fact probably occurs under nature and if so natural selection will be able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes as is sometimes the case with insects. and this leads me to say a few words on what i call sexual selection. this depends not on a struggle for existence but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or no offspring. sexual selection is therefore less rigorous than natural selection. generally the most vigorous males those which are best fitted for their places in nature will leave most progeny. but in many cases victory will depend not on general vigour but on having special weapons confined to the male sex. a hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage length to the spur and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg as well as the brutal cockfighter who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. how low in the scale of nature this law of battle descends i know not male alligators have been described as fighting bellowing and whirling round like indians in a wardance for the possession of the females male salmons have been seen fighting all day long male stagbeetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males. the war is perhaps severest between the males of polygamous animals and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. the males of carnivorous animals are already well armed though to them and to others special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection as the mane to the lion the shoulderpad to the boar and the hooked jaw to the male salmon for the shield may be as important for victory as the sword or spear. amongst birds the contest is often of a more peaceful character. all those who have attended to the subject believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females. the rockthrush of guiana birds of paradise and some others congregate and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform strange antics before the females which standing by as spectators at last choose the most attractive partner. those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes thus sir r. heron has described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds. it may appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means i cannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view but if man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams according to his standard of beauty i can see no good reason to doubt that female birds by selecting during thousands of generations the most melodious or beautiful males according to their standard of beauty might produce a marked effect. i strongly suspect that some wellknown laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds in comparison with the plumage of the young can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons either by the males alone or by the males and females but i have not space here to enter on this subject. thus it is as i believe that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life but differ in structure colour or ornament such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection that is individual males have had in successive generations some slight advantage over other males in their weapons means of defence or charms and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring. yet i would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency for we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals as the wattle in male carriers hornlike protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls etc. which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in battle or attractive to the females. we see analogous cases under nature for instance the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkeycock which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this birdindeed had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been called a monstrosity. illustrations of the action of natural selection.in order to make it clear how as i believe natural selection acts i must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. let us take the case of a wolf which preys on various animals securing some by craft some by strength and some by fleetness and let us suppose that the fleetest prey a deer for instance had from any change in the country increased in numbers or that other prey had decreased in numbers during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food. i can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving and so be preserved or selectedprovided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the year when they might be compelled to prey on other animals. i can see no more reason to doubt this than that man can improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed. even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey. nor can this be thought very improbable for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals one cat for instance taking to catch rats another mice one cat according to mr. st. john bringing home winged game another hares or rabbits and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. the tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited. now if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure and by the repetition of this process a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parentform of wolf. or again the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district and those frequenting the lowlands would naturally be forced to hunt different prey and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites two varieties might slowly be formed. these varieties would cross and blend where they met but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return. i may add that according to mr. pierce there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the catskill mountains in the united states one with a light greyhoundlike form which pursues deer and the other more bulky with shorter legs which more frequently attacks the shepherds flocks. let us now take a more complex case. certain plants excrete a sweet juice apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some leguminos and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel. this juice though small in quantity is greedily sought by insects. let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the petals of a flower. in this case insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen and would certainly often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower. the flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed and the act of crossing we have good reason to believe as will hereafter be more fully alluded to would produce very vigorous seedlings which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving. some of these seedlings would probably inherit the nectarexcreting power. those individual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries and which excreted most nectar would be oftenest visited by insects and would be oftenest crossed and so in the longrun would gain the upper hand. those flowers also which had their stamens and pistils placed in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which visited them so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower would likewise be favoured or selected. we might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation its destruction appears a simple loss to the plant yet if a little pollen were carried at first occasionally and then habitually by the pollendevouring insects from flower to flower and a cross thus effected although ninetenths of the pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant and those individuals which produced more and more pollen and had larger and larger anthers would be selected.  when our plant by this process of the continued preservation or natural selection of more and more attractive flowers had been rendered highly attractive to insects they would unintentionally on their part regularly carry pollen from flower to flower and that they can most effectually do this i could easily show by many striking instances. i will give only onenot as a very striking case but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants presently to be alluded to. some hollytrees bear only male flowers which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen and a rudimentary pistil other hollytrees bear only female flowers these have a fullsized pistil and four stamens with shrivelled anthers in which not a grain of pollen can be detected. having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree i put the stigmas of twenty flowers taken from different branches under the microscope and on all without exception there were pollengrains and on some a profusion of pollen. as the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree the pollen could not thus have been carried. the weather had been cold and boisterous and therefore not favourable to bees nevertheless every female flower which i examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees accidentally dusted with pollen having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. but to return to our imaginary case as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower another process might commence. no naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the physiological division of labour hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant and pistils alone in another flower or on another plant. in plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour individuals with this tendency more and more increased would be continually favoured or selected until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be effected. let us now turn to the nectarfeeding insects in our imaginary case we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection to be a common plant and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food. i could give many facts showing how anxious bees are to save time for instance their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers which they can with a very little more trouble enter by the mouth. bearing such facts in mind i can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of the body or in the curvature and length of the proboscis etc. far too slight to be appreciated by us might profit a bee or other insect so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more quickly and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants. its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight deviation of structure. the tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers trifolium pratense and incarnatum do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length yet the hivebee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover but not out of the common red clover which is visited by humblebees alone so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hivebee. thus it might be a great advantage to the hivebee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. on the other hand i have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla so as to push the pollen on to the stigmatic surface. hence again if humblebees were to become rare in any country it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla so that the hivebee could visit its flowers. thus i can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become either simultaneously or one after the other modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure. i am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection exemplified in the above imaginary instances is open to the same objections which were at first urged against sir charles lyells noble views on the modern changes of the earth as illustrative of geology but we now very seldom hear the action for instance of the coastwaves called a trifling and insignificant cause when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs. natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications each profitable to the preserved being and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave so will natural selection if it be a true principle banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings or of any great and sudden modification in their structure. on the intercrossing of individuals.i must here introduce a short digression. in the case of animals and plants with separated sexes it is of course obvious that two individuals must always unite for each birth but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. nevertheless i am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals either occasionally or habitually concur for the reproduction of their kind. this view i may add was first suggested by andrew knight. we shall presently see its importance but i must here treat the subject with extreme brevity though i have the materials prepared for an ample discussion. all vertebrate animals all insects and some other large groups of animals pair for each birth. modern research has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair that is two individuals regularly unite for reproduction which is all that concerns us. but still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. what reason it may be asked is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction? as it is impossible here to enter on details i must trust to some general considerations alone. in the first place i have collected so large a body of facts showing in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain gives vigour and fertility to the offspring and on the other hand that close interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law that no organic being selffertilises itself for an eternity of generations but that a cross with another individual is occasionallyperhaps at very long intervalsindispensable. on the belief that this is a law of nature we can i think understand several large classes of facts such as the following which on any other view are inexplicable. every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather! but if an occasional cross be indispensable the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure more especially as the plants own anthers and pistil generally stand so close together that selffertilisation seems almost inevitable. many flowers on the other hand have their organs of fructification closely enclosed as in the great papilionaceous or peafamily but in several perhaps in all such flowers there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar for in doing this they either push the flowers own pollen on the stigma or bring pollen from another flower. so necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers that i have found by experiments published elsewhere that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented. now it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower and not carry pollen from one to the other to the great good as i believe of the plant. bees will act like a camelhair pencil and it is quite sufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species for if you bring on the same brush a plants own pollen and pollen from another species the former will have such a prepotent effect that it will invariably and completely destroy as has been shown by grtner any influence from the foreign pollen. when the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil or slowly move one after the other towards it the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure selffertilisation and no doubt it is useful for this end but the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward as klreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry and curiously in this very genus which seems to have a special contrivance for selffertilisation it is well known that if very closelyallied forms or varieties are planted near each other it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings so largely do they naturally cross. in many other cases far from there being any aids for selffertilisation there are special contrivances as i could show from the writings of c. c. sprengel and from my own observations which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower for instance in lobelia fulgens there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous pollengranules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them and as this flower is never visited at least in my garden by insects it never sets a seed though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another i raised plenty of seedlings and whilst another species of lobelia growing close by which is visited by bees seeds freely. in very many other cases though there be no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen yet as c. c. sprengel has shown and as i can confirm either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready so that these plants have in fact separated sexes and must habitually be crossed. how strange are these facts! how strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower though placed so close together as if for the very purpose of selffertilisation should in so many cases be mutually useless to each other! how simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable! if several varieties of the cabbage radish onion and of some other plants be allowed to seed near each other a large majority as i have found of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels for instance i raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties growing near each other and of these only 78 were true to their kind and some even of these were not perfectly true. yet the pistil of each cabbageflower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant. how then comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized? i suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent effect over a flowers own pollen and that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. when distinct species are crossed the case is directly the reverse for a plants own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen but to this in the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers it may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree and that flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited sense. i believe this objection to be valid but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes. when the sexes are separated although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree we can see that pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower and this will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. that trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than other plants i find to be the case in this country and at my request dr. hooker tabulated the trees of new zealand and dr. asa gray those of the united states and the result was as i anticipated. on the other hand dr. hooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold in australia and i have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject. turning for a very brief space to animals on the land there are some hermaphrodites as landmollusca and earthworms but these all pair. as yet i have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises itself. we can understand this remarkable fact which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live and the nature of the fertilising element for we know of no means analogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals. of aquatic animals there are many selffertilising hermaphrodites but here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional cross. and as in the case of flowers i have as yet failed after consultation with one of the highest authorities namely professor huxley to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body that access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible. cirripedes long appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this point of view but i have been enabled by a fortunate chance elsewhere to prove that two individuals though both are selffertilising hermaphrodites do sometimes cross. it must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that in the case of both animals and plants species of the same family and even of the same genus though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole organisation yet are not rarely some of them hermaphrodites and some of them unisexual. but if in fact all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross with other individuals the difference between hermaphrodites and unisexual species as far as function is concerned becomes very small. from these several considerations and from the many special facts which i have collected but which i am not here able to give i am strongly inclined to suspect that both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature. i am well aware that there are on this view many cases of difficulty some of which i am trying to investigate. finally then we may conclude that in many organic beings a cross between two individuals is an obvious necessity for each birth in many others it occurs perhaps only at long intervals but in none as i suspect can selffertilisation go on for perpetuity. circumstances favourable to natural selection.this is an extremely intricate subject. a large amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable but i believe mere individual differences suffice for the work. a large number of individuals by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual and is i believe an extremely important element of success. though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection she does not grant an indefinite period for as all organic beings are striving it may be said to seize on each place in the economy of nature if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors it will soon be exterminated. in mans methodical selection a breeder selects for some definite object and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. but when many men without intending to alter the breed have a nearly common standard of perfection and all try to get and breed from the best animals much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with inferior animals. thus it will be in nature for within a confined area with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be natural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction though in different degrees so as better to fill up the unoccupied place. but if the area be large its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several districts there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the confines of each. and in this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each for in a continuous area the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another. the intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each birth which wander much and which do not breed at a very quick rate. hence in animals of this nature for instance in birds varieties will generally be confined to separated countries and this i believe to be the case. in hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally and likewise in animals which unite for each birth but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot and might there maintain itself in a body so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety. a local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts. on the above principle nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened. even in the case of slowbreeding animals which unite for each birth we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural selection for i can bring a considerable catalogue of facts showing that within the same area varieties of the same animal can long remain distinct from haunting different stations from breeding at slightly different seasons or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair together. intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species or of the same variety true and uniform in character. it will obviously thus act far more efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth but i have already attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants. even if these take place only at long intervals i am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from longcontinued selffertilisation that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind and thus in the long run the influence of intercrosses even at rare intervals will be great. if there exist organic beings which never intercross uniformity of character can be retained amongst them as long as their conditions of life remain the same only through the principle of inheritance and through natural selection destroying any which depart from the proper type but if their conditions of life change and they undergo modification uniformity of character can be given to their modified offspring solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable variations. isolation also is an important element in the process of natural selection. in a confined or isolated area if not very large the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree uniform so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to the same conditions. intercrosses also with the individuals of the same species which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts will be prevented. but isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better adapted organisms after any physical change such as of climate or elevation of the land etc. and thus new places in the natural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for and become adapted to through modifications in their structure and constitution. lastly isolation by checking immigration and consequently competition will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species. if however an isolated area be very small either from being surrounded by barriers or from having very peculiar physical conditions the total number of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small and fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new species through natural selection by decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations. if we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks and look at any small isolated area such as an oceanic island although the total number of the species inhabiting it will be found to be small as we species a very large proportion are endemicthat is have been produced there and nowhere else. hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species. but we may thus greatly deceive ourselves for to ascertain whether a small isolated area or a large open area like a continent has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms we ought to make the comparison within equal times and this we are incapable of doing. although i do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the production of new species on the whole i am inclined to believe that largeness of area is of more importance more especially in the production of species which will prove capable of enduring for a long period and of spreading widely. throughout a great and open area not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing species and if some of these many species become modified and improved others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated. each new form also as soon as it has been much improved will be able to spread over the open and continuous area and will thus come into competition with many others. hence more new places will be formed and the competition to fill them will be more severe on a large than on a small and isolated area. moreover great areas though now continuous owing to oscillations of level will often have recently existed in a broken condition so that the good effects of isolation will generally to a certain extent have concurred. finally i conclude that although small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new species yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas and what is more important that the new forms produced on large areas which already have been victorious over many competitors will be those that will spread most widely will give rise to most new varieties and species and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world. we can perhaps on these views understand some facts which will be instance that the productions of the smaller continent of australia have formerly yielded and apparently are now yielding before those of the larger europoasiatic area. thus also it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. on a small island the race for life will have been less severe and there will have been less modification and less extermination. hence perhaps it comes that the flora of madeira according to oswald heer resembles the extinct tertiary flora of europe. all freshwater basins taken together make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land and consequently the competition between freshwater productions will have been less severe than elsewhere new forms will have been more slowly formed and old forms more slowly exterminated. and it is in fresh water that we find seven genera of ganoid fishes remnants of a once preponderant order and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world as the ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren which like fossils connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale. these anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils they have endured to the present day from having inhabited a confined area and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition. to sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. i conclude looking to the future that for terrestrial productions a large continental area which will probably undergo many oscillations of level and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition will be the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life likely to endure long and to spread widely. for the area will first have existed as a continent and the inhabitants at this period numerous in individuals and kinds will have been subjected to very severe competition. when converted by subsidence into large separate islands there will still exist many individuals of the same species on each island intercrossing on the confines of the range of each species will thus be checked after physical changes of any kind immigration will be prevented so that new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old inhabitants and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected. when by renewed elevation the islands shall be reconverted into a continental area there will again be severe competition the most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread there will be much extinction of the less improved forms and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants and thus produce new species. that natural selection will always act with extreme slowness i fully admit. its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country undergoing modification of some kind. the existence of such places will often depend on physical changes which are generally very slow and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked. but the action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified the mutual relations of many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed. nothing can be effected unless favourable variations occur and variation itself is apparently always a very slow process. the process will often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing. many will exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection. i do not believe so. on the other hand i do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly often only at long intervals of time and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. i further believe that this very slow intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed. slow though the process of selection may be if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection i can see no limit to the amount of change to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings one with another and with their physical conditions of life which may be effected in the long course of time by natures power of selection. on geology but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural selection. natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous which consequently endure. but as from the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants it follows that as each selected and favoured form increases in number so will the less favoured forms decrease and become rare. rarity as geology tells us is the precursor to extinction. we can also see that any form represented by few individuals will during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies run a good chance of utter extinction. but we may go further than this for as new forms are continually and slowly being produced unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing numbers inevitably must become extinct. that the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased geology shows us plainly and indeed we can see reason why they should not have thus increased for the number of places in the polity of nature is not indefinitely greatnot that we have any means of knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species. probably no region is as yet fully stocked for at the cape of good hope where more species of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the world some foreign plants have become naturalised without causing as far as we know the extinction of any natives. furthermore the species which are most numerous in individuals will have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations. we have evidence of this in the facts given in the second greatest number of recorded varieties or incipient species. hence rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period and they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species. from these several considerations i think it inevitably follows that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection others will become rarer and rarer and finally extinct. the forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement will naturally suffer most. and we have closelyallied formsvarieties of the same species and species of the same genus or of related generawhich from having nearly the same structure constitution and habits generally come into the severest competition with each other. consequently each new variety or species during the progress of its formation will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred and tend to exterminate them. we see the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated productions through the selection of improved forms by man. many curious instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle sheep and other animals and varieties of flowers take the place of older and inferior kinds. in yorkshire it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the longhorns and that these were swept away by the shorthorns i quote the words of an agricultural writer as if by some murderous pestilence. divergence of character.the principle which i have designated by this term is of high importance on my theory and explains as i believe several important facts. in the first place varieties even stronglymarked ones though having somewhat of the character of speciesas is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank themyet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species. nevertheless according to my view varieties are species in the process of formation or are as i have called them incipient species. how then does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species? that this does habitually happen we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting wellmarked differences whereas varieties the supposed prototypes and parents of future wellmarked species present slight and illdefined differences. mere chance as we may call it might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus. as has always been my practice let us seek light on this head from our domestic productions. we shall here find something analogous. a fancier is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak and on the acknowledged principle that fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard but like extremes they both go on as has actually occurred with tumblerpigeons choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks or with shorter and shorter beaks. again we may suppose that at an early period one man preferred swifter horses another stronger and more bulky horses. the early differences would be very slight in the course of time from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders and of stronger ones by others the differences would become greater and would be noted as forming two subbreeds finally after the lapse of centuries the subbreeds would become converted into two wellestablished and distinct breeds. as the differences slowly become greater the inferior animals with intermediate characters being neither very swift nor very strong will have been neglected and will have tended to disappear. here then we see in mans productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence causing differences at first barely appreciable steadily to increase and the breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their common parent. but how it may be asked can any analogous principle apply in nature? i believe it can and does apply most efficiently from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure constitution and habits by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature and so be enabled to increase in numbers.  we can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits. take the case of a carnivorous quadruped of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average. if its natural powers of increase be allowed to act it can succeed in increasing the country not undergoing any change in its conditions only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals some of them for instance being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey either dead or alive some inhabiting new stations climbing trees frequenting water and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. the more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became the more places they would be enabled to occupy. what applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animalsthat is if they varyfor otherwise natural selection can do nothing. so it will be with plants. it has been experimentally proved that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be raised. the same has been found to hold good when first one variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground. hence if any one species of grass were to go on varying and those varieties were continually selected which differed from each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses differ from each other a greater number of individual plants of this species of grass including its modified descendants would succeed in living on the same piece of ground. and we well know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds and thus as it may be said is striving its utmost to increase its numbers. consequently i cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of generations the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties and varieties when rendered very distinct from each other take the rank of species. the truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure is seen under many natural circumstances. in an extremely small area especially if freely open to immigration and where the contest between individual and individual must be severe we always find great diversity in its inhabitants. for instance i found that a piece of turf three feet by four in size which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same conditions supported twenty species of plants and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders which shows how much these plants differed from each other. so it is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets and so in small ponds of fresh water. farmers find that they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation. most of the animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground could live on it supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there but it is seen that where they come into the closest competition with each other the advantages of diversification of structure with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution determine that the inhabitants which thus jostle each other most closely shall as a general rule belong to what we call different genera and orders. the same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through mans agency in foreign lands. it might have been expected that the plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country. it might also perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes. but the case is very different and alph. de candolle has well remarked in his great and admirable work that floras gain by naturalisation proportionally with the number of the native genera and species far more in new genera than in new species. to give a single instance in the last edition of dr. asa grays manual of the flora of the northern united states 260 naturalised plants are enumerated and these belong to 162 genera. we thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature. they differ moreover to a large extent from the indigenes for out of the 162 genera no less than 100 genera are not there indigenous and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of these states. by considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled successfully with the indigenes of any country and have there become naturalised we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives would have had to be modified in order to have gained an advantage over the other natives and we may i think at least safely infer that diversification of structure amounting to new generic differences would have been profitable to them. the advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is in fact the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual bodya subject so well elucidated by milne edwards. no physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone or flesh alone draws most nutriment from these substances. so in the general economy of any land the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting themselves. a set of animals with their organisation but little diversified could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. it may be doubted for instance whether the australian marsupials which are divided into groups differing but little from each other and feebly representing as mr. waterhouse and others have remarked our carnivorous ruminant and rodent mammals could successfully compete with these wellpronounced orders. in the australian mammals we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development. after the foregoing discussion which ought to have been much amplified we may i think assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. now let us see how this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence of character combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction will tend to act. the accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather perplexing subject. let a to l represent the species of a genus large in its own country these species are supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances. i have said a large genus because we have seen in the that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small genera and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties. we have also seen that the species which are the commonest and the most widelydiffused vary more than rare species with restricted ranges. let a be a common widelydiffused and varying species belonging to a genus large in its own country. the little fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from a may represent its varying offspring. the variations are supposed to be extremely slight but of the most diversified nature they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously but often after long intervals of time nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. only those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected. and here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character comes in for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations represented by the outer dotted lines being preserved and accumulated by natural selection. when a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines and is there marked by a small numbered letter a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed a fairly wellmarked variety such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work. the intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram may represent each a thousand generations but it would have been better if each had represented ten thousand generations. after a thousand generations species a is supposed to have produced two fairly wellmarked varieties namely a1 and m1. these two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary consequently they will tend to vary and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their parents varied. moreover these two varieties being only slightly modified forms will tend to inherit those advantages which made their common parent a more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country they will likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parentspecies belonged a large genus in its own country. and these circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new varieties. if then these two varieties be variable the most divergent of their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand generations. and after this interval variety a1 is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a2 which will owing to the principle of divergence differ more from a than did variety a1. variety m1 is supposed to have produced two varieties namely m2 and s2 differing from each other and more considerably from their common parent a. we may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time some of the varieties after each thousand generations producing only a single variety but in a more and more modified condition some producing two or three varieties and some failing to produce any. thus the varieties or modified descendants proceeding from the common parent a will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character. in the diagram the process is represented up to the tenthousandth generation and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteenthousandth generation. but i must here remark that i do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram though in itself made somewhat irregular. i am far from thinking that the most divergent varieties will invariably prevail and multiply a medium form may often long endure and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings and this will depend on infinitely complex relations. but as a general rule the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered the more places they will be enabled to seize on and the more their modified progeny will be increased. in our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties. but these breaks are imaginary and might have been inserted anywhere after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation. as all the modified descendants from a common and widelydiffused species belonging to a large genus will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from a. the modified offspring from the later and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent will it is probable often take the place of and so destroy the earlier and less improved branches this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. in some cases i do not doubt that the process of modification will be confined to a single line of descent and the number of the descendants will not be increased although the amount of divergent modification may have been increased in the successive generations. this case would be represented in the diagram if all the lines proceeding from a were removed excepting that from a1 to a10. in the same way for instance the english racehorse and english pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks without either having given off any fresh branches or races. after ten thousand generations species a is supposed to have produced three forms a10 f10 and m10 which from having diverged in character during the successive generations will have come to differ largely but perhaps unequally from each other and from their common parent. if we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small these three forms may still be only wellmarked varieties or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of subspecies but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount to convert these three forms into welldefined species thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species. by continuing the same process for a greater number of generations as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner we get eight species marked by the letters between a14 and m14 all descended from a. thus as i believe species are multiplied and genera are formed. in a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary. in the diagram i have assumed that a second species i has produced by analogous steps after ten thousand generations either two wellmarked varieties w10 and z10 or two species according to the amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. after fourteen thousand generations six new species marked by the letters n14 to z14 are supposed to have been produced. in each genus the species which are already extremely different in character will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature hence in the diagram i have chosen the extreme species a and the nearly extreme species i as those which have largely varied and have given rise to new varieties and species. the other nine species marked by capital letters of our original genus may for a long period continue transmitting unaltered descendants and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space. but during the process of modification represented in the diagram another of our principles namely that of extinction will have played an important part. as in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent. for it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits constitution and structure. hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states that is between the less and more improved state of a species as well as the original parentspecies itself will generally tend to become extinct. so it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent. if however the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct country or become quickly adapted to some quite new station in which child and parent do not come into competition both may continue to exist. if then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of modification species a and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct having been replaced by eight new species a14 to m14 and i will have been replaced by six n14 to z14 new species. but we may go further than this. the original species of our genus were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature species a being more nearly related to b c and d than to the other species and species i more to g h k l than to the others. these two species a and i were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species so that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus. their modified descendants fourteen in number at the fourteenthousandth generation will probably have inherited some of the same advantages they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country. it seems therefore to me extremely probable that they will have taken the places of and thus exterminated not only their parents a and i but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly related to their parents. hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteenthousandth generation. we may suppose that only one f of the two species which were least closely related to the other nine original species has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent.  the new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species will now be fifteen in number. owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection the extreme amount of difference in character between species a14 and z14 will be much greater than that between the most different of the original eleven species. the new species moreover will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. of the eight descendants from a the three marked a14 q14 p14 will be nearly related from having recently branched off from a10 b14 and f14 from having diverged at an earlier period from a5 will be in some degree distinct from the three firstnamed species and lastly 014 e4 and m14 will be nearly related one to the other but from having diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification will be widely different from the other five species and may constitute a subgenus or even a distinct genus. the six descendants from i will form two subgenera or even genera. but as the original species i differed largely from a standing nearly at the extreme points of the original genus the six descendants from i will owing to inheritance differ considerably from the eight descendants from a the two groups moreover are supposed to have gone on diverging in different directions. the intermediate species also and this is a very important consideration which connected the original species a and i have all become excepting f extinct and have left no descendants. hence the six new species descended from i and the eight descended from a will have to be ranked as very distinct genera or even as distinct subfamilies. thus it is as i believe that two or more genera are produced by descent with modification from two or more species of the same genus. and the two or more parentspecies are supposed to have descended from some one species of an earlier genus. in our diagram this is indicated by the broken lines beneath the capital letters converging in subbranches downwards towards a single point this point representing a single species the supposed single parent of our several new subgenera and genera. it is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new species f14 which is supposed not to have diverged much in character but to have retained the form of f either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree. in this case its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. having descended from a form which stood between the two parentspecies a and i now supposed to be extinct and unknown it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these species. but as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents the new species f14 will not be directly intermediate between them but rather between types of the two groups and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind. in the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to represent a thousand generations but each may represent a million or hundred million generations and likewise a section of the successive strata of the earths crust including extinct remains. we shall when and i think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings which though generally belonging to the same orders or families or genera with those now living yet are often in some degree intermediate in character between existing groups and we can understand this fact for the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less. i see no reason to limit the process of modification as now explained to the formation of genera alone. if in our diagram we suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be very great the forms marked a14 to p14 those marked b14 and f14 and those marked o14 to m14 will form three very distinct genera. we shall also have two very distinct genera descended from i and as these latter two genera both from continued divergence of character and from inheritance from a different parent will differ widely from the three genera descended from a the two little groups of genera will form two distinct families or even orders according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. and the two new families or orders will have descended from two species of the original genus and these two species are supposed to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown genus. we have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species. this indeed might have been expected for as natural selection acts through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage and the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common. hence the struggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly lie between the larger groups which are all trying to increase in number. one large group will slowly conquer another large group reduce its numbers and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement. within the same large group the later and more highly perfected subgroups from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of nature will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved subgroups. small and broken groups and subgroups will finally tend to disappear. looking to the future we can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant and which are least broken up that is which as yet have suffered least extinction will for a long period continue to increase. but which groups will ultimately prevail no man can predict for we well know that many groups formerly most extensively developed have now become extinct. looking still more remotely to the future we may predict that owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct and leave no modified descendants and consequently that of the species living at any one period extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity. i but i may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species having transmitted descendants and on the view of all the descendants of the same species making a class we can understand how it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. although extremely few of the most ancient species may now have living and modified descendants yet at the most remote geological period the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many genera families orders and classes as at the present day. varying conditions of life organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation and i think this cannot be disputed if there be owing to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species at some age season or year a severe struggle for life and this certainly cannot be disputed then considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence causing an infinite diversity in structure constitution and habits to be advantageous to them i think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each beings own welfare in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. but if variations useful to any organic being do occur assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. this principle of preservation i have called for the sake of brevity natural selection. natural selection on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages can modify the egg seed or young as easily as the adult. amongst many animals sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring. sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone in their struggles with other males. whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of entails extinction and how largely extinction has acted in the worlds history geology plainly declares. natural selection also leads to divergence of character for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure habits and constitution of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants of any small spot or at naturalised productions. therefore during the modification of the descendants of any one species and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers the more diversified these descendants become the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle of life. thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus or even of distinct genera. we have seen that it is the common the widelydiffused and widelyranging species belonging to the larger genera which vary most and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries. natural selection as has just been remarked leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life. on these principles i believe the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be explained. it is a truly wonderful factthe wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiaritythat all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group in the manner which we everywhere beholdnamely varieties of the same species most closely related together species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together forming sections and subgenera species of distinct genera much less closely related and genera related in different degrees forming subfamilies families orders subclasses and classes. the several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file but seem rather to be clustered round points and these round other points and so on in almost endless cycles. on the view that each species has been independently created i can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings but to the best of my judgment it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection entailing extinction and divergence of character as we have seen illustrated in the diagram. the affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. i believe this simile largely speaks the truth. the green and budding twigs may represent existing species and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. at each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. the limbs divided into great branches and these into lesser and lesser branches were themselves once when the tree was small budding twigs and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush only two or three now grown into great branches yet survive and bear all the other branches so with the species which lived during longpast geological periods very few now have living and modified descendants. from the first growth of the tree many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders families and genera which have now no living representatives and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. as we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit so we occasionally see an animal like the ornithorhynchus or lepidosiren which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. as buds give rise by growth to fresh buds and these if vigorous branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch so by generation i believe it has been with the great tree of life which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.   laws of variation.  effects of external

under domestication and in a lesser degree in those in a state of naturehad been due to chance. this of course is a wholly incorrect expression but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. some authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences or very slight deviations of structure as to make the child like its parents. but the much greater variability as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities under domestication or cultivation than under nature leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions of life to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several generations. i have remarked given would be necessary to show the truth of the remarkthat the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life and to this system being functionally disturbed in the parents i chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring. the male and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new being. in the case of sporting plants the bud which in its earliest condition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule is alone affected. but why because the reproductive system is disturbed this or that part should vary more or less we are profoundly ignorant. nevertheless we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light and we may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of structure however slight. how much direct effect difference of climate food etc. produces on any being is extremely doubtful. my impression is that the effect is extremely small in the case of animals but perhaps rather more in that of plants. we may at least safely conclude that such influences cannot have produced the many striking and complex coadaptations of structure between one organic being and another which we see everywhere throughout nature. some little influence may be attributed to climate food etc. thus e. forbes speaks confidently that shells at their southern limit and when living in shallow water are more brightly coloured than those of the same species further north or from greater depths. gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere than when living on islands or near the coast. so with insects wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects their colours. moquintandon gives a list of plants which when growing near the seashore have their leaves in some degree fleshy though not elsewhere fleshy. several other such cases could be given. the fact of varieties of one species when they range into the zone of habitation of other species often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the characters of such species accords with our view that species of all kinds are only wellmarked and permanent varieties. thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally brightercoloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas. the birds which are confined to continents are according to mr. gould brightercoloured than those of islands. the insectspecies confined to seacoasts as every collector knows are often brassy or lurid. plants which live exclusively on the seaside are very apt to have fleshy leaves. he who believes in the creation of each species will have to say that this shell for instance was created with bright colours for a warm sea but that this other shell became brightcoloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters. when a variation is of the slightest use to a being we cannot tell how much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection and how much to the conditions of life. thus it is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more severe the climate is under which they have lived but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmestclad individuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations and how much to the direct action of the severe climate? for it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds. instances could be given of the same variety being produced under conditions of life as different as can well be conceived and on the other hand of different varieties being produced from the same species under the same conditions. such facts show how indirectly into the zone of habitation of other species often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the characters of such species accords with our view that species of all kinds are only wellmarked and permanent varieties. thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally brightercoloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas. the birds which are confined to continents are according to mr. gould brightercoloured than those of islands. the insectspecies confined to seacoasts as every collector knows are often brassy or lurid. plants which live exclusively on the seaside are very apt to have fleshy leaves. he who believes in the creation of each species will have to say that this shell for instance was created with bright colours for a warm sea but that this other shell became brightcoloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters. the conditions of life must act. again innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of species keeping true or not varying at all although living under the most opposite climates. such considerations as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of the conditions of life. indirectly as already remarked they seem to play an important part in affecting the reproductive system and in thus inducing variability and natural selection will then accumulate all profitable variations however slight until they become plainly developed and appreciable by us. effects of use and disuse.from the facts alluded to in the first animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts and disuse diminishes them and that such modifications are inherited. under free nature we can have no standard of comparison by which to judge of the effects of longcontinued use or disuse for we know not the parentforms but many animals have structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. as professor owen has remarked there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly yet there are several in this state. the loggerheaded duck of south america can only flap along the surface of the water and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic aylesbury duck. as the larger groundfeeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger i believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands tenanted by no beast of prey has been caused by disuse. the ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies as well as any of the smaller quadrupeds. we may imagine that the early progenitor of the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard and that as natural selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of its body its legs were used more and its wings less until they became incapable of flight. kirby has remarked and i have observed the same fact that the anterior tarsi or feet of many male dungfeeding beetles are very often broken off he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection and not one had even a relic left. in the onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost that the insect has been described as not having them. in some other genera they are present but in a rudimentary condition. in the ateuchus or sacred beetle of the egyptians they are totally deficient. there is not sufficient evidence to induce us to believe that mutilations are ever inherited and i should prefer explaining the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in ateuchus and their rudimentary condition in some other genera by the longcontinued effects of disuse in their progenitors for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many dungfeeding beetles they must be lost early in life and therefore cannot be much used by these insects. in some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure which are wholly or mainly due to natural selection. mr. wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles out of the 550 species inhabiting madeira are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly and that of the twentynine endemic genera no less than twentythree genera have all their species in this condition! several facts namely that beetles in many parts of the world are very frequently blown to sea and perish that the beetles in madeira as observed by mr. wollaston lie much concealed until the wind lulls and the sun shines that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed dezertas than in madeira itself and especially the extraordinary fact so strongly insisted on by mr. wollaston of the almost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles elsewhere excessively numerous and which groups have habits of life almost necessitating frequent flightthese several considerations have made me believe that the wingless condition of so many madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection but combined probably with disuse. for during thousands of successive generations each individual beetle which flew least either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit will have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea and on the other hand those beetles which most readily took to flight will oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed. the insects in madeira which are not groundfeeders and which as the flowerfeeding coleoptera and lepidoptera must habitually use their wings to gain their subsistence have as mr. wollaston suspects their wings not at all reduced but even enlarged. this is quite compatible with the action of natural selection. for when a new insect first arrived on the island the tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings would depend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. as with mariners shipwrecked near a coast it would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck.  the eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. this state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse but aided perhaps by natural selection. in south america a burrowing rodent the tucotuco or ctenomys is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole and i was assured by a spaniard who had often caught them that they were frequently blind one which i kept alive was certainly in this condition the cause as appeared on dissection having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. as frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with subterranean habits a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them might in such case be an advantage and if so natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse. it is well known that several animals belonging to the most different classes which inhabit the caves of styria and of kentucky are blind. in some of the crabs the footstalk for the eye remains though the eye is gone the stand for the telescope is there though the telescope with its glasses has been lost. as it is difficult to imagine that eyes though useless could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness i attribute their loss wholly to disuse. in one of the blind animals namely the caverat the eyes are of immense size and professor silliman thought that it regained after living some days in the light some slight power of vision. in the same manner as in madeira the wings of some of the insects have been enlarged and the wings of others have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse so in the case of the caverat natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and to have increased the size of the eyes whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves disuse by itself seems to have done its work. it is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate so that on the common view of the blind animals having been separately created for the american and european caverns close similarity in their organisation and affinities might have been expected but as schidte and others have remarked this is not the case and the caveinsects of the two continents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated from the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of north america and europe. on my view we must suppose that american animals having ordinary powers of vision slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the kentucky caves as did european animals into the caves of europe. we have some evidence of this gradation of habit for as schidte remarks animals not far remote from ordinary forms prepare the transition from light to darkness. next follow those that are constructed for twilight and last of all those destined for total darkness. by the time that an animal had reached after numberless generations the deepest recesses disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes and natural selection will often have effected other changes such as an increase in the length of the antenn or palpi as a compensation for blindness. notwithstanding such modifications we might expect still to see in the caveanimals of america affinities to the other inhabitants of that continent and in those of europe to the inhabitants of the european continent. and this is the case with some of the american caveanimals as i hear from professor dana and some of the european caveinsects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding country. it would be most difficult to give any rational explanation of the affinities of the blind caveanimals to the other inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation. that several of the inhabitants of the caves of the old and new worlds should be closely related we might expect from the wellknown relationship of most of their other productions. far from feeling any surprise that some of the caveanimals should be very anomalous as agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish the amblyopsis and as is the case with the blind proteus with reference to the reptiles of europe i am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark abodes will probably have been exposed. acclimatisation.habit is hereditary with plants as in the period of flowering in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate in the time of sleep etc. and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. as it is extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and very cold countries and as i believe that all the species of the same genus have descended from a single parent if this view be correct acclimatisation must be readily effected during longcontinued descent. it is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate or conversely. so again many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate. but the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live is often overrated. we may infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate and from the number of plants and animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health. we have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as or more than by adaptation to particular climates. but whether or not the adaptation be generally very close we have evidence in the case of some few plants of their becoming to a certain extent naturally habituated to different temperatures or becoming acclimatised thus the pines and rhododendrons raised from seed collected by dr. hooker from trees growing at different heights on the himalaya were found in this country to possess different constitutional powers of resisting cold. mr. thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in ceylon and analogous observations have been made by mr. h. c. watson on european species of plants brought from the azores to england. in regard to animals several authentic cases could be given of species within historical times having largely extended their range from warmer to cooler latitudes and conversely but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case nor do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes. as i believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by uncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under confinement and not because they were subsequently found capable of farextended transportation i think the common and extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates but of being perfectly fertile a far severer test under them may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely different climates. we must not however push the foregoing argument too far on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several wild stocks the blood for instance of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. the rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals but they have been transported by man to many parts of the world and now have a far wider range than any other rodent living free under the cold climate of faroe in the north and of the falklands in the south and on many islands in the torrid zones. hence i am inclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution which is common to most animals. on this view the capacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic animals and such facts as that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a glacial climate whereas the living species are now all tropical or subtropical in their habits ought not to be looked at as anomalies but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution brought under peculiar circumstances into play. how much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit and how much to the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions and how much to both means combined is a very obscure question. that habit or custom has some influence i must believe both from analogy and from the incessant advice given in agricultural works even in the ancient encyclopdias of china to be very cautious in transposing animals from one district to another for it is not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and subbreeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts the result must i think be due to habit. on the other hand i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve those individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries. in treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others this is very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the united states in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern states and as most of these varieties are of recent origin they cannot owe their constitutional differences to habit. the case of the jerusalem artichoke which is never propagated by seed and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced has even been advancedfor it is now as tender as ever it wasas proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! the case also of the kidneybean has been often cited for a similar purpose and with much greater weight but until some one will sow during a score of generations his kidneybeans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost and then collect seed from the few survivors with care to prevent accidental crosses and then again get seed from these seedlings with the same precautions the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried. nor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling kidneybeans ever appear for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than others. on the whole i think we may conclude that habit use and disuse have in some cases played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution and of the structure of various organs but that the effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with and sometimes overmastered by the natural selection of innate differences. correlation of growth.i mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied together during its growth and development that when slight variations in any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection other parts become modified. this is a very important subject most imperfectly understood. the most obvious case is that modifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva will it may safely be concluded affect the structure of the adult in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo seriously affects the whole organisation of the adult. the several parts of the body which are homologous and which at an early embryonic period are alike seem liable to vary in an allied manner we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner in the front and hind legs and even in the jaws and limbs varying together for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs. these tendencies i do not doubt may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection. homologous parts as has been remarked by some authors tend to cohere this is often seen in monstrous plants and nothing is more common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures as the union of the petals of the corolla into a tube. hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts it is believed by some authors that the diversity in the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of their kidneys. others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child. in snakes according to schlegel the shape of the body and the manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera. the nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure. m. is. geoffroy st. hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations very frequently and that others rarely coexist without our being able to assign any reason. what can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats and the tortoiseshell colour with the female sex the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons and the presence of more or less down on the young birds when first hatched with the future colour of their plumage or again the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked turkish dog though here probably homology comes into play? with respect to this latter case of correlation i think it can hardly be accidental that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal coverings viz. cetacea whales and edentata armadilloes scaly anteaters etc. that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth. i know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation in modifying important structures independently of utility and therefore of natural selection than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some compositous and umbelliferous plants. every one knows the difference in the ray and central florets of for instance the daisy and this difference is often accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower. but in some compositous plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture and even the ovary itself with its accessory parts differs as has been described by cassini. these differences have been attributed by some authors to pressure and the shape of the seeds in the rayflorets in some composit countenances this idea but in the case of the corolla of the umbellifer it is by no means as dr. hooker informs me in species with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most frequently differ. it might have been thought that the development of the raypetals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of the flower had caused their abortion but in some composit there is a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any difference in the corolla. possibly these several differences may be connected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central and external flowers we know at least that in irregular flowers those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria and become regular. i may add as an instance of this and of a striking case of correlation that i have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums that the central flower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two upper petals and that when this occurs the adherent nectary is quite aborted when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals the nectary is only much shortened. with respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel i do not feel at all sure that c. c. sprengels idea that the rayflorets serve to attract insects whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these two orders is so farfetched as it may at first appear and if it be advantageous natural selection may have come into play. but in regard to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant yet in the umbellifer these differences are of such apparent importancethe seeds being in some cases according to tausch orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowersthat the elder de candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences. hence we see that modifications of structure viewed by systematists as of high value may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth and without being as far as we can see of the slightest service to the species. we may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth structures which are common to whole groups of species and which in truth are simply due to inheritance for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure and after thousands of generations some other and independent modification and these two modifications having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits would naturally be thought to be correlated in some necessary manner. so again i do not doubt that some apparent correlations occurring throughout whole orders are entirely due to the manner alone in which natural selection can act. for instance alph. de candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open i should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection except in fruits which opened so that the individual plants producing seeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further might get an advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal and this process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open. the elder geoffroy and goethe propounded at about the same period their law of compensation or balancement of growth or as goethe expressed it in order to spend on one side nature is forced to economise on the other side. i think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess it rarely flows at least in excess to another part thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. the same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oilbearing seeds. when the seeds in our fruits become atrophied the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality. in our poultry a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb and a large beard by diminished wattles. with species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application but many good observers more especially botanists believe in its truth. i will not however here give any instances for i see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects on the one hand of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by this same process or by disuse and on the other hand the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part. i suspect also that some of the cases of compensation which have been advanced and likewise some other facts may be merged under a more general principle namely that natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation. if under changed conditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful any diminution however slight in its development will be seized on by natural selection for it will profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up an useless structure. i can thus only understand a fact with which i was much struck when examining cirripedes and of which many other instances could be given namely that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace. this is the case with the male ibla and in a truly extraordinary manner with the proteolepas for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highlyimportant anterior segments of the head enormously developed and furnished with great nerves and muscles but in the parasitic and protected proteolepas the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile antenn. now the saving of a large and complex structure when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the proteolepas though effected by slow steps would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed each individual proteolepas would have a better chance of supporting itself by less nutriment being wasted in developing a structure now become useless. thus as i believe natural selection will always succeed in the long run in reducing and saving every part of the organisation as soon as it is rendered superfluous without by any means causing some other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. and conversely that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some adjoining part.  it seems to be a rule as remarked by is. geoffroy st. hilaire both in varieties and in species that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the structure of the same individual as the vertebr in snakes and the stamens in polyandrous flowers the number is variable whereas the number of the same part or organ when it occurs in lesser numbers is constant. the same author and some botanists have further remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure. inasmuch as this vegetative repetition to use professor owens expression seems to be a sign of low organisation the foregoing remark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which are higher. i presume that lowness in this case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised for particular functions and as long as the same part has to perform diversified work we can perhaps see why it should remain variable that is why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for one special purpose alone. in the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape whilst a tool for some particular object had better be of some particular shape. natural selection it should never be forgotten can act on each part of each being solely through and for its advantage. rudimentary parts it has been stated by some authors and i believe with truth are apt to be highly variable. we shall have to recur to the general subject of rudimentary and aborted organs and i will here only add that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness and therefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure. thus rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws of growth to the effects of longcontinued disuse and to the tendency to reversion. a part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner in comparison with the same part in allied species tends to be highly variable.several years ago i was much struck with a remark nearly to the above effect published by mr. waterhouse. i infer also from an observation made by professor owen with respect to the length of the arms of the ourangoutang that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion. it is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition without giving the long array of facts which i have collected and which cannot possibly be here introduced. i can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality. i am aware of several causes of error but i hope that i have made due allowance for them. it should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part however unusually developed unless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in closely allied species. thus the bats wing is a most abnormal structure in the class mammalia but the rule would not here apply because there is a whole group of bats having wings it would apply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus. the rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters when displayed in any unusual manner. the term secondary sexual characters used by hunter applies to characters which are attached to one sex but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction. the rule applies to males and females but as females more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters it applies more rarely to them. the rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters may be due to the great variability of these characters whether or not displayed in any unusual mannerof which fact i think there can be little doubt. but that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes and i may here add that i particularly attended to mr. waterhouses remark whilst investigating this order and i am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with cirripedes. i shall in my future work give a list of the more remarkable cases i will here only briefly give one as it illustrates the rule in its largest application. the opercular valves of sessile cirripedes rock barnacles are in every sense of the word very important structures and they differ extremely little even in different genera but in the several species of one genus pyrgoma these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape and the amount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so great that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the characters of these important valves than do other species of distinct genera. as birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree i have particularly attended to them and the rule seems to me certainly to hold good in this class. i cannot make out that it applies to plants and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth had not the great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability. when we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in any species the fair presumption is that it is of high importance to that species nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to variation. why should this be so? on the view that each species has been independently created with all its parts as we now see them i can see no explanation. but on the view that groups of species have descended from other species and have been modified through natural selection i think we can obtain some light. in our domestic animals if any part or the whole animal be neglected and no selection be applied that part for instance the comb in the dorking fowl or the whole breed will cease to have a nearly uniform character. the breed will then be said to have degenerated. in rudimentary organs and in those which have been but little specialised for any particular purpose and perhaps in polymorphic groups we see a nearly parallel natural case for in such cases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. but what here more especially concerns us is that in our domestic animals those points which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued selection are also eminently liable to variation. look at the breeds of the pigeon see what a prodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers in the beak and wattle of the different carriers in the carriage and tail of our fantails etc. these being the points now mainly attended to by english fanciers. even in the subbreeds as in the shortfaced tumbler it is notoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection and frequently individuals are born which depart widely from the standard. there may be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between on the one hand the tendency to reversion to a less modified state as well as an innate tendency to further variability of all kinds and on the other hand the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. in the long run selection gains the day and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good shortfaced strain. but as long as selection is rapidly going on there may always be expected to be much variability in the structure undergoing modification. it further deserves notice that these variable characters produced by mans selection sometimes become attached from causes quite unknown to us more to one sex than to the other generally to the male sex as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters. now let us turn to nature. when a part has been developed in an extraordinary manner in any one species compared with the other species of the same genus we may conclude that this part has undergone an extraordinary amount of modification since the period when the species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. this period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree as species very rarely endure for more than one geological period. an extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and longcontinued amount of variability which has continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species. but as the variability of the extraordinarilydeveloped part or organ has been so great and longcontinued within a period not excessively remote we might as a general rule expect still to find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant. and this i am convinced is the case. that the struggle between natural selection on the one hand and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand will in the course of time cease and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant i can see no reason to doubt. hence when an organ however abnormal it may be has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to many modified descendants as in the case of the wing of the bat it must have existed according to my theory for an immense period in nearly the same state and thus it comes to be no more variable than any other structure. it is only in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the generative variability as it may be called still present in a high degree. for in this case the variability will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals varying in the required manner and degree and by the continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition. the principle included in these remarks may be extended. it is notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic. to explain by a simple example what is meant. if some species in a large genus of plants had blue flowers and some had red the colour would be only a specific character and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red or conversely but if all the species had blue flowers the colour would become a generic character and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance. i have chosen this example because an explanation is not in this case applicable which most naturalists would advance namely that specific characters are more variable than generic because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera. i believe this explanation is partly yet only indirectly true i shall however have to return superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement that specific characters are more variable than generic but i have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history that when an author has remarked with surprise that some important organ or part which is generally very constant throughout large groups of species has differed considerably in closelyallied species that it has also been variable in the individuals of some of the species. and this fact shows that a character which is generally of generic value when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value often becomes variable though its physiological importance may remain the same. something of the same kind applies to monstrosities at least is. geoffroy st. hilaire seems to entertain no doubt that the more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same group the more subject it is to individual anomalies. on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why should that part of the structure which differs from the same part in other independentlycreated species of the same genus be more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several species? i do not see that any explanation can be given. but on the view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties we might surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period and which have thus come to differ. or to state the case in another mannerthe points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other and in which they differ from the species of some other genus are called generic characters and these characters in common i attribute to inheritance from a common progenitor for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several species fitted to more or less widelydifferent habits in exactly the same manner and as these socalled generic characters have been inherited from a remote period since that period when the species first branched off from their common progenitor and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree or only in a slight degree it is not probable that they should vary at the present day. on the other hand the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus are called specific characters and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the species from a common progenitor it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variableat least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant. in connexion with the present subject i will make only two other remarks. i think it will be admitted without my entering on details that secondary sexual characters are very variable i think it also will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters than in other parts of their organisation compare for instance the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed with the amount of difference between their females and the truth of this proposition will be granted. the cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest but we can see why these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection as it does not entail death but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males. whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual characters as they are highly variable sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action and may thus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their sexual characters than in other parts of their structure. it is a remarkable fact that the secondary sexual differences between the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus differ from each other. of this fact i will give in illustration two instances the first which happen to stand on my list and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature the relation can hardly be accidental. the same number of joints in the tarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles but in the engid as westwood has remarked the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species again in fossorial hymenoptera the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance because common to large groups but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species and likewise in the two sexes of the same species. this relation has a clear meaning on my view of the subject i look at all the species of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same progenitor as have the two sexes of any one of the species. consequently whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor or of its early descendants became variable variations of this part would it is highly probable be taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection in order to fit the several species to their several places in the economy of nature and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same species to each other or to fit the males and females to different habits of life or the males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females. finally then i conclude that the greater variability of specific characters or those which distinguish species from species than of generic characters or those which the species possess in commonthat the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners and the not great degree of variability in a part however extraordinarily it may be developed if it be common to a whole group of speciesthat the great variability of secondary sexual characters and the great amount of difference in these same characters between closely allied speciesthat secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the organisationare all principles closely connected together. all being mainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a common progenitor from whom they have inherited much in commonto parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not variedto natural selection having more or less completely according to the lapse of time overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variabilityto sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selectionand to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection and thus adapted for secondary sexual and for ordinary specific purposes.  distinct species present analogous variations and a variety of one species often assumes some of the characters of an allied species or reverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor.these propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic races. the most distinct breeds of pigeons in countries most widely apart present subvarieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on the feetcharacters not possessed by the aboriginal rockpigeon these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct races. the frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tailfeathers in the pouter may be considered as a variation representing the normal structure of another race the fantail. i presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation when acted on by similar unknown influences. in the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation in the enlarged stems or roots as commonly called of the swedish turnip and ruta baga plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent if this be not so the case will then be one of analogous variation in two socalled distinct species and to these a third may be added namely the common turnip. according to the ordinary view of each species having been independently created we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants not to the vera causa of community of descent and a consequent tendency to vary in a like manner but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation. with pigeons however we have another case namely the occasional appearance in all the breeds of slatyblue birds with two black bars on the wings a white rump a bar at the end of the tail with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases with white. as all these marks are characteristic of the parent rockpigeon i presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds. we may i think confidently come to this conclusion because as we have seen these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slatyblue with the several marks beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance. no doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after having been lost for many perhaps for hundreds of generations. but when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed for many generationssome say for a dozen or even a score of generations. after twelve generations the proportion of blood to use a common expression of any one ancestor is only 1 in 2048 and yet as we see it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood. in a breed which has not been crossed but in which both parents have lost some character which their progenitor possessed the tendency whether strong or weak to reproduce the lost character might be as was formerly remarked for all that we can see to the contrary transmitted for almost any number of generations. when a character which has been lost in a breed reappears after a great number of generations the most probable hypothesis is not that the offspring suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations distant but that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in question which at last under unknown favourable conditions gains an ascendancy. for instance it is probable that in each generation of the barbpigeon which produces most rarely a blue and blackbarred bird there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume this colour. this view is hypothetical but could be supported by some facts and i can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of generations than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being as we all know them to be thus inherited. indeed we may sometimes observe a mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited for instance in the common snapdragon antirrhinum a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it. as all the species of the same genus are supposed on my theory to have descended from a common parent it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner so that a variety of one species would resemble in some of its characters another species this other species being on my view only a wellmarked and permanent variety. but characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature for the presence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection in accordance with the diverse habits of the species and will not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited constitution. it might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters. as however we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a group we could not distinguish these two cases if for instance we did not know that the rockpigeon was not featherfooted or turncrowned we could not have told whether these characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of reversion from the number of the markings which are correlated with the blue tint and which it does not appear probable would all appear together from simple variation. more especially we might have inferred this from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed. hence though under nature it must generally be left doubtful what cases are reversions to an anciently existing character and what are new but analogous variations yet we ought on my theory sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species assuming characters either from reversion or from analogous variation which already occur in some other members of the same group. and this undoubtedly is the case in nature. a considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in our systematic works is due to its varieties mocking as it were some of the other species of the same genus. a considerable catalogue also could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species and this shows unless all these forms be considered as independently created species that the one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other so as to produce the intermediate form. but the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire in some degree the character of the same part or organ in an allied species. i have collected a long list of such cases but here as before i lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give them. i can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur and seem to me very remarkable. i will however give one curious and complex case not indeed as affecting any important character but from occurring in several species of the same genus partly under domestication and partly under nature. it is a case apparently of reversion. the ass not rarely has very distinct transverse bars on its legs like those on the legs of a zebra it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal and from inquiries which i have made i believe this to be true. it has also been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double. the shoulder stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline. a white ass but not an albino has been described without either spinal or shoulderstripe and these stripes are sometimes very obscure or actually quite lost in darkcoloured asses. the koulan of pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulderstripe. the hemionus has no shoulderstripe but traces of it as stated by mr. blyth and others occasionally appear and i have been informed by colonel poole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs and faintly on the shoulder. the quagga though so plainly barred like a zebra over the body is without bars on the legs but dr. gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebralike bars on the hocks. with respect to the horse i have collected cases in england of the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds and of all colours transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns mouseduns and in one instance in a chestnut a faint shoulderstripe may sometimes be seen in duns and i have seen a trace in a bay horse. my son made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun belgian carthorse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with legstripes and a man whom i can implicitly trust has examined for me a small dun welch pony with three short parallel stripes on each shoulder. in the northwest part of india the kattywar breed of horses is so generally striped that as i hear from colonel poole who examined the breed for the indian government a horse without stripes is not considered as purelybred. the spine is always striped the legs are generally barred and the shoulderstripe which is sometimes double and sometimes treble is common the side of the face moreover is sometimes striped. the stripes are plainest in the foal and sometimes quite disappear in old horses. colonel poole has seen both gray and bay kattywar horses striped when first foaled. i have also reason to suspect from information given me by mr. w. w. edwards that with the english racehorse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the fullgrown animal. without here entering on further details i may state that i have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds in various countries from britain to eastern china and from norway in the north to the malay archipelago in the south. in all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouseduns by the term dun a large range of colour is included from one between brown and black to a close approach to creamcolour. i am aware that colonel hamilton smith who has written on this subject believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several aboriginal speciesone of which the dun was striped and that the abovedescribed appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun stock. but i am not at all satisfied with this theory and should be loth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy belgian carthorse welch ponies cobs the lanky kattywar race etc. inhabiting the most distant parts of the world. now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the horsegenus. rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs. i once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra and mr. w. c. martin in his excellent treatise on the horse has given a figure of a similar mule. in four coloured drawings which i have seen of hybrids between the ass and zebra the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the body and in one of them there was a double shoulderstripe. in lord moretons famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga the hybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black arabian sire were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga. lastly and this is another most remarkable case a hybrid has been figured by dr. gray and he informs me that he knows of a second case from the ass and the hemionus and this hybrid though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulderstripe nevertheless had all four legs barred and had three short shoulderstripes like those on the dun welch pony and even had some zebralike stripes on the sides of its face. with respect to this last fact i was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an accident that i was led solely from the occurrence of the facestripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to ask colonel poole whether such facestripes ever occur in the eminently striped kattywar breed of horses and was as we have seen answered in the affirmative. what now are we to say to these several facts? we see several very distinct species of the horsegenus becoming by simple variation striped on the legs like a zebra or striped on the shoulders like an ass. in the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appearsa tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the genus. the appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character. we see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct species. now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons they are descended from a pigeon including two or three subspecies or geographical races of a bluish colour with certain bars and other marks and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint these bars and other marks invariably reappear but without any other change of form or character. when the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels. i have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters isthat there is a tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce the longlost character and that this tendency from unknown causes sometimes prevails. and we have just seen that in several species of the horsegenus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in the old. call the breeds of pigeons some of which have bred true for centuries species and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horsegenus! for myself i venture confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations and i see an animal striped like a zebra but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed the common parent of our domestic horse whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks of the ass the hemionus quagga and zebra. he who believes that each equine species was independently created will i presume assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary both under nature and under domestication in this particular manner so as often to become striped like other species of the genus and that each has been created with a strong tendency when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes not their own parents but other species of the genus. to admit this view is as it seems to me to reject a real for an unreal or at least for an unknown cause. it makes the works of god a mere mockery and deception i would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists that fossil shells had never lived but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the seashore. summary.our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part differs more or less from the same part in the parents. but whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same species and the greater differences between species of the same genus. the external conditions of life as climate and food etc. seem to have induced some slight modifications. habit in producing constitutional differences and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs seem to have been more potent in their effects. homologous parts tend to vary in the same way and homologous parts tend to cohere. modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts. when one part is largely developed perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts and every part of the structure which can be saved without detriment to the individual will be saved. changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts subsequently developed and there are very many other correlations of growth the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand. multiple parts are variable in number and in structure perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely specialised to any particular function so that their modifications have not been closely checked by natural selection. it is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole organisation more specialised and are higher in the scale. rudimentary organs from being useless will be disregarded by natural selection and hence probably are variable. specific charactersthat is the characters which have come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched off from a common parentare more variable than generic characters or those which have long been inherited and have not differed within this same period. in these remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still variable because they have recently varied and thus come to differ applies to the whole individual for in a district where many species of any genus are foundthat is where there has been much former variation and differentiation or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at workthere on an average we now find most varieties or incipient species. secondary sexual characters are highly variable and such characters differ much in the species of the same group. variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the same species and specific differences to the several species of the same genus. any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose and thus we can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts for variation is a longcontinued and slow process and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state. but when a species with any extraordinarilydeveloped organ has become the parent of many modified descendantswhich on my view must be a very slow process requiring a long lapse of timein this case natural selection may readily have succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ in however extraordinary a manner it may be developed. species inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences will naturally tend to present analogous variations and these same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient progenitors. although new and important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous variation such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.  whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parentsand a cause for each must existit is the steady accumulation through natural selection of such differences when beneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the best adapted to survive.   difficulties on theory.  difficulties on the theory of descent with modification. transitions. absence or rarity of transitional varieties. transitions in habits of life. diversified habits in the same species. species with habits widely different from those of their allies. organs of extreme perfection. means of transition. cases of difficulty. natura non facit saltum. organs of small importance. organs not in all cases absolutely perfect. the law of unity of type and of the conditions of existence embraced by the theory of natural selection.  long before having arrived at this part of my work a crowd of difficulties will have occurred to the reader. some of them are so grave that to this day i can never reflect on them without being staggered but to the best of my judgment the greater number are only apparent and those that are real are not i think fatal to my theory. these difficulties and objections may be classed under the following heads firstly why if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being as we see them well defined? secondly is it possible that an animal having for instance the structure and habits of a bat could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? can we believe that natural selection could produce on the one hand organs of trifling importance such as the tail of a giraffe which serves as a flyflapper and on the other hand organs of such wonderful structure as the eye of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection? thirdly can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection? what shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which leads the bee to make cells which have practically anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians? fourthly how can we account for species when crossed being sterile and producing sterile offspring whereas when varieties are crossed their fertility is unimpaired? the two first heads shall be here discussedinstinct and hybridism in on the absence or rarity of transitional varieties.as natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications each new form will tend in a fullystocked country to take the place of and finally to exterminate its own less improved parent or other lessfavoured forms with which it comes into competition. thus extinction and natural selection will as we have seen go hand in hand. hence if we look at each species as descended from some other unknown form both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the new form. but as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth? it will be much more convenient to discuss this and i will here only state that i believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting profound depths of the sea and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea whilst it slowly subsides. these contingencies will concur only rarely and after enormously long intervals. whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising or when very little sediment is being deposited there will be blanks in our geological history. the crust of the earth is a vast museum but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote. but it may be urged that when several closelyallied species inhabit the same territory we surely ought to find at the present time many transitional forms. let us take a simple case in travelling from north to south over a continent we generally meet at successive intervals with closely allied or representative species evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land. these representative species often meet and interlock and as the one becomes rarer and rarer the other becomes more and more frequent till the one replaces the other. but if we compare these species where they intermingle they are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each. by my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent and during the process of modification each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states. hence we ought not to expect at the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each region though they must have existed there and may be embedded there in a fossil condition. but in the intermediate region having intermediate conditions of life why do we not now find closelylinking intermediate varieties? this difficulty for a long time quite confounded me. but i think it can be in large part explained. in the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring because an area is now continuous that it has been continuous during a long period. geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones. by changes in the form of the land and of climate marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present. but i will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty for i believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas though i do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the formation of new species more especially with freelycrossing and wandering animals. in looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines and finally disappearing. hence the neutral territory between two representative species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to each. we see the same fact in ascending mountains and sometimes it is quite remarkable how abruptly as alph. de candolle has observed a common alpine species disappears. the same fact has been noticed by forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. to those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the allimportant elements of distribution these facts ought to cause surprise as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. but when we bear in mind that almost every species even in its metropolis would increase immensely in numbers were it not for other competing species that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others in short that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic beings we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions but in large part on the presence of other species on which it depends or by which it is destroyed or with which it comes into competition and as these species are already defined objects however they may have become so not blending one into another by insensible gradations the range of any one species depending as it does on the range of others will tend to be sharply defined. moreover each species on the confines of its range where it exists in lessened numbers will during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey or in the seasons be extremely liable to utter extermination and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply defined. if i am right in believing that allied or representative species when inhabiting a continuous area are generally so distributed that each has a wide range with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer then as varieties do not essentially differ from species the same rule will probably apply to both and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very large area we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone. the intermediate variety consequently will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area and practically as far as i can make out this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature. i have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between wellmarked varieties in the genus balanus. and it would appear from information given me by mr. watson dr. asa gray and mr. wollaston that generally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. now if we may trust these facts and inferences and therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect then i think we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periodswhy as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear sooner than the forms which they originally linked together. for any form existing in lesser numbers would as already remarked run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers and in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it. but a far more important consideration as i believe is that during the process of further modification by which two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two distinct species the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. for forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance within any given period of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. hence the more common forms in the race for life will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms for these will be more slowly modified and improved. it is the same principle which as i believe accounts for the common species in each country as shown in wellmarked varieties than do the rarer species. i may illustrate what i mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept one adapted to an extensive mountainous region a second to a comparatively narrow hilly tract and a third to wide plains at the base and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow hilly tract and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed and thus the two breeds which originally existed in greater numbers will come into close contact with each other without the interposition of the supplanted intermediate hillvariety. to sum up i believe that species come to be tolerably welldefined objects and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links firstly because new varieties are very slowly formed for variation is a very slow process and natural selection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants. and such new places will depend on slow changes of climate or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants and probably in a still more important degree on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other. so that in any one region and at any one time we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent and this assuredly we do see. secondly areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent period in isolated portions in which many forms more especially amongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species. in this case intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent must formerly have existed in each broken portion of the land but these links will have been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural selection so that they will no longer exist in a living state. thirdly when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous area intermediate varieties will it is probable at first have been formed in the intermediate zones but they will generally have had a short duration. for these intermediate varieties will from reasons already assigned namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species and likewise of acknowledged varieties exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. from this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination and during the process of further modification through natural selection they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect for these from existing in greater numbers will in the aggregate present more variation and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages. lastly looking not to any one time but to all time if my theory be true numberless intermediate varieties linking most closely all the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed but the very process of natural selection constantly tends as has been so often remarked to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links. consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains which are preserved as we shall in a intermittent record. on the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and structure.it has been asked by the opponents of such views as i hold how for instance a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one with aquatic habits for how could the animal in its transitional state have subsisted? it would be easy to show that within the same group carnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits and as each exists by a struggle for life it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place in nature. look at the mustela vison of north america which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur short legs and form of tail during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters and preys like other polecats on mice and land animals. if a different case had been taken and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a flying bat the question would have been far more difficult and i could have given no answer. yet i think such difficulties have very little weight. here as on other occasions i lie under a heavy disadvantage for out of the many striking cases which i have collected i can give only one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species of the same genus and of diversified habits either constant or occasional in the same species. and it seems to me that nothing less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular case like that of the bat. look at the family of squirrels here we have the finest gradation from animals with their tails only slightly flattened and from others as sir j. richardson has remarked with the posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full to the socalled flying squirrels and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree. we cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey or to collect food more quickly or as there is reason to believe by lessening the danger from occasional falls. but it does not follow from this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive under all natural conditions. let the climate and vegetation change let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate or old ones become modified and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated unless they also became modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner. therefore i can see no difficulty more especially under changing conditions of life in the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flankmembranes each modification being useful each being propagated until by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection a perfect socalled flying squirrel was produced. now look at the galeopithecus or flying lemur which formerly was falsely ranked amongst bats. it has an extremely wide flankmembrane stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail and including the limbs and the elongated fingers the flank membrane is also furnished with an extensor muscle. although no graduated links of structure fitted for gliding through the air now connect the galeopithecus with the other lemurid yet i can see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed and that each had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels and that each grade of structure had been useful to its possessor. nor can i see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membraneconnected fingers and forearm of the galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection and this as far as the organs of flight are concerned would convert it into a bat. in bats which have the wingmembrane extended from the top of the shoulder to the tail including the hindlegs we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight. if about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown who would have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which used their wings solely as flappers like the loggerheaded duck micropterus of eyton as fins in the water and front legs on the land like the penguin as sails like the ostrich and functionally for no purpose like the apteryx. yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it under the conditions of life to which it is exposed for each has to live by a struggle but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions. it must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of wingstructure here alluded to which perhaps may all have resulted from disuse indicate the natural steps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight but they serve at least to show what diversified means of transition are possible. seeing that a few members of such waterbreathing classes as the crustacea and mollusca are adapted to live on the land and seeing that we have flying birds and mammals flying insects of the most diversified types and formerly had flying reptiles it is conceivable that flyingfish which now glide far through the air slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins might have been modified into perfectly winged animals. if this had been effected who would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean and had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively as far as we know to escape being devoured by other fish? when we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit as the wings of a bird for flight we should bear in mind that animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to exist to the present day for they will have been supplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection. furthermore we may conclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms. thus to return to our imaginary illustration of the flyingfish it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms for taking prey of many kinds in many ways on the land and in the water until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life. hence the chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less from their having existed in lesser numbers than in the case of species with fully developed structures. i will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits in the individuals of the same species. when either case occurs it would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal by some modification of its structure for its changed habits or exclusively for one of its several different habits. but it is difficult to tell and immaterial for us whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards or whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits both probably often change almost simultaneously. of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many british insects which now feed on exotic plants or exclusively on artificial substances. of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given i have often watched a tyrant flycatcher saurophagus sulphuratus in south america hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another like a kestrel and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water and then dashing like a kingfisher at a fish. in our own country the larger titmouse parus major may be seen climbing branches almost like a creeper it often like a shrike kills small birds by blows on the head and i have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. in north america the black bear was seen by hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth thus catching like a whale insects in the water. even in so extreme a case as this if the supply of insects were constant and if better adapted competitors did not already exist in the country i can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered by natural selection more and more aquatic in their structure and habits with larger and larger mouths till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale. as we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely different from those both of their own species and of the other species of the same genus we might expect on my theory that such individuals would occasionally have given rise to new species having anomalous habits and with their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of their proper type. and such instances do occur in nature. can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? yet in north america there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing and on the plains of la plata where not a tree grows there is a woodpecker which in every essential part of its organisation even in its colouring in the harsh tone of its voice and undulatory flight told me plainly of its close bloodrelationship to our common species yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree! petrels are the most arial and oceanic of birds yet in the quiet sounds of tierra del fuego the puffinuria berardi in its general habits in its astonishing power of diving its manner of swimming and of flying when unwillingly it takes flight would be mistaken by any one for an auk or grebe nevertheless it is essentially a petrel but with many parts of its organisation profoundly modified. on the other hand the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the waterouzel would never have suspected its subaquatic habits yet this anomalous member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by divinggrasping the stones with its feet and using its wings under water. he who believes that each being has been created as we now see it must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having habits and structure not at all in agreement. what can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water and no one except audubon has seen the frigatebird which has all its four toes webbed alight on the surface of the sea. on the other hand grebes and coots are eminently aquatic although their toes are only bordered by membrane. what seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants yet the waterhen is nearly as aquatic as the coot and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. in such cases and many others could be given habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. the webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in function though not in structure. in the frigatebird the deeplyscooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change. he who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say that in these cases it has pleased the creator to cause a being of one type to take the place of one of another type but this seems to me only restating the fact in dignified language. he who believes in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers and that if any one being vary ever so little either in habits or structure and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the country it will seize on the place of that inhabitant however different it may be from its own place. hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigatebirds with webbed feet either living on the dry land or most rarely alighting on the water that there should be longtoed corncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps that there should be woodpeckers where not a tree grows that there should be diving thrushes and petrels with the habits of auks. organs of extreme perfection and complication.to suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural selection seems i freely confess absurd in the highest possible degree. yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple each grade being useful to its possessor can be shown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so slightly and the variations be inherited which is certainly the case and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though insuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real. how a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated but i may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound. in looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been perfected we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors but this is scarcely ever possible and we are forced in each case to look to species of the same group that is to the collateral descendants from the same original parentform in order to see what gradations are possible and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the earlier stages of descent in an unaltered or little altered condition. amongst existing vertebrata we find but a small amount of gradation in the structure of the eye and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this head. in this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages by which the eye has been perfected. in the articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and without any other mechanism and from this low stage numerous gradations of structure branching off in two fundamentally different lines can be shown to exist until we reach a moderately high stage of perfection. in certain crustaceans for instance there is a double cornea the inner one divided into facets within each of which there is a lensshaped swelling. in other crustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment and which properly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light are convex at their upper ends and must act by convergence and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance. with these facts here far too briefly and imperfectly given which show that there is much graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans and bearing in mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct i can see no very great difficulty not more than in the case of many other structures in believing that natural selection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great articulate class. he who will go thus far if he find on finishing this treatise that large bodies of facts otherwise inexplicable can be explained by the theory of descent ought not to hesitate to go further and to admit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural selection although in this case he does not know any of the transitional grades. his reason ought to conquer his imagination though i have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths. it is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. we know that this instrument has been perfected by the longcontinued efforts of the highest human intellects and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. but may not this inference be presumptuous? have we any right to assume that the creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? if we must compare the eye to an optical instrument we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue with a nerve sensitive to light beneath and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses placed at different distances from each other and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers and carefully selecting each alteration which under varied circumstances may in any way or in any degree tend to produce a distincter image. we must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million and each to be preserved till a better be produced and then the old ones to be destroyed. in living bodies variation will cause the slight alterations generation will multiply them almost infinitely and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. let this process go on for millions on millions of years and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass as the works of the creator are to those of man? if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down. but i can find out no such case. no doubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades more especially if we look to muchisolated species round which according to my theory there has been much extinction. or again if we look to an organ common to all the members of a large class for in this latter case the organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period since which all the many members of the class have been developed and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has passed we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms long since become extinct. we should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. numerous cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions thus the alimentary canal respires digests and excretes in the larva of the dragonfly and in the fish cobites. in the hydra the animal may be turned inside out and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. in such cases natural selection might easily specialise if any advantage were thus gained a part or organ which had performed two functions for one function alone and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps. two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the same individual to give one instance there are fish with gills or branchi that breathe the air dissolved in the water at the same time that they breathe free air in their swimbladders this latter organ having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply and being divided by highly vascular partitions. in these cases one of the two organs might with ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself being aided during the process of modification by the other organ and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose or be quite obliterated. the illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose namely flotation may be converted into one for a wholly different purpose namely respiration. the swimbladder has also been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fish or for i do not know which view is now generally held a part of the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the swimbladder. all physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous or ideally similar in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into a lung or organ used exclusively for respiration. i can indeed hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype of which we know nothing furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder. we can thus as i infer from professor owens interesting description of these parts understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea with some risk of falling into the lungs notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is closed. in the higher vertebrata the branchi have wholly disappearedthe slits on the sides of the neck and the looplike course of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position. but it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchi might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose in the same manner as on the view entertained by some naturalists that the branchi and dorsal scales of annelids are homologous with the wings and wingcovers of insects it is probable that organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of flight. in considering transitions of organs it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another that i will give one more instance. pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of skin called by me the ovigerous frena which serve through the means of a sticky secretion to retain the eggs until they are hatched within the sack. these cirripedes have no branchi the whole surface of the body and sack including the small frena serving for respiration. the balanid or sessile cirripedes on the other hand have no ovigerous frena the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack in the wellenclosed shell but they have large folded branchi. now i think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the branchi of the other family indeed they graduate into each other. therefore i do not doubt that little folds of skin which originally served as ovigerous frena but which likewise very slightly aided the act of respiration have been gradually converted by natural selection into branchi simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands. if all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct and they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes who would ever have imagined that the branchi in this latter family had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of the sack? although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could not possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations yet undoubtedly grave cases of difficulty occur some of which will be discussed in my future work. one of the gravest is that of neuter insects which are often very differently constructed from either the males or fertile females but of fishes offer another case of special difficulty it is impossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced but as owen and others have remarked their intimate structure closely resembles that of common muscle and as it has lately been shown that rays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus and yet do not as matteuchi asserts discharge any electricity we must own that we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible. the electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty for they occur in only about a dozen fishes of which several are widely remote in their affinities. generally when the same organ appears in several members of the same class especially if in members having very different habits of life we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse or natural selection. but if the electric organs had been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to each other. nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric organs which most of their modified descendants have lost. the presence of luminous organs in a few insects belonging to different families and orders offers a parallel case of difficulty. other cases could be given for instance in plants the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollengrains borne on a footstalk with a sticky gland at the end is the same in orchis and asclepiasgenera almost as remote as possible amongst flowering plants. in all these cases of two very distinct species furnished with apparently the same anomalous organ it should be observed that although the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected. i am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on the very same invention so natural selection working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings which owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor. although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what transitions an organ could have arrived at its present state yet considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct and unknown is very small i have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. the truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural history of natura non facit saltum. we meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist or as milne edwards has well expressed it nature is prodigal in variety but niggard in innovation. why on the theory of creation should this be so? why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature be so invariably linked together by graduated steps? why should not nature have taken a leap from structure to structure? on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand why she should not for natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations she can never take a leap but must advance by the shortest and slowest steps. organs of little apparent importance.as natural selection acts by life and deathby the preservation of individuals with any favourable variation and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation of structurei have sometimes felt much difficulty in understanding the origin of simple parts of which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals. i have sometimes felt as much difficulty though of a very different kind on this head as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye. in the first place we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications instances of most trifling characters such as the down on fruit and the colour of the flesh which from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated with constitutional differences might assuredly be acted on by natural selection. the tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed flyflapper and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications each better and better for so trifling an object as driving away flies yet we should pause before being too positive even in this case for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in south america absolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects so that individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. it is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed except in some rare cases by the flies but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced so that they are more subject to disease or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food or to escape from beasts of prey. organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high importance to an early progenitor and after having been slowly perfected at a former period have been transmitted in nearly the same state although now become of very slight use and any actually injurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural selection. seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals its general presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals which in their lungs or modified swimbladders betray their aquatic origin may perhaps be thus accounted for. a welldeveloped tail having been formed in an aquatic animal it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes as a flyflapper an organ of prehension or as an aid in turning as with the dog though the aid must be slight for the hare with hardly any tail can double quickly enough. in the second place we may sometimes attribute importance to characters which are really of very little importance and which have originated from quite secondary causes independently of natural selection. we should remember that climate food etc. probably have some little direct influence on the organisation that characters reappear from the law of reversion that correlation of growth will have had a most important influence in modifying various structures and finally that sexual selection will often have largely modified the external characters of animals having a will to give one male an advantage in fighting with another or in charming the females. moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes it may at first have been of no advantage to the species but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly acquired habits. to give a few instances to illustrate these latter remarks. if green woodpeckers alone had existed and we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds i dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this treefrequenting bird from its enemies and consequently that it was a character of importance and might have been acquired through natural selection as it is i have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause probably to sexual selection. a trailing bamboo in the malay archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches and this contrivance no doubt is of the highest service to the plant but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber. the naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity and so it may be or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference when we see that the skin on the head of the cleanfeeding male turkey is likewise naked. the sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition and no doubt they facilitate or may be indispensable for this act but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles which have only to escape from a broken egg we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals. we are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countriesmore especially in the less civilized countries where there has been but little artificial selection. careful observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair and that with the hair the horns are correlated. mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more and possibly even the form of the pelvis and then by the law of homologous variation the front limbs and even the head would probably be affected. the shape also of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb. the laborious breathing necessary in high regions would we have some reason to believe increase the size of the chest and again correlation would come into play. animals kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection and individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed best under different climates and there is reason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated. a good observer also states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection. but we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known and unknown laws of variation and i have here alluded to them only to show that if we are unable to account for the characteristic differences of our domestic breeds which nevertheless we generally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation we ought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences between species. i might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man which are so strongly marked i may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous. the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor. they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man or for mere variety. this doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to my theory. yet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessors. physical conditions probably have had some little effect on structure quite independently of any good thus gained. correlation of growth has no doubt played a most important part and a useful modification of one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use. so again characters which formerly were useful or which formerly had arisen from correlation of growth or from other unknown cause may reappear from the law of reversion though now of no direct use. the effects of sexual selection when displayed in beauty to charm the females can be called useful only in rather a forced sense. but by far the most important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance and consequently though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature many structures now have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species. thus we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose or of the frigatebird are of special use to these birds we cannot believe that the same bones in the arm of the monkey in the fore leg of the horse in the wing of the bat and in the flipper of the seal are of special use to these animals. we may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. but to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigatebird webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds. so we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a flipper but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey horse and bat which have been inherited from a common progenitor were formerly of more special use to that progenitor or its progenitors than they now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits. therefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired through natural selection subjected formerly as now to the several laws of inheritance reversion correlation of growth etc. hence every detail of structure in every living creature making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been of special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants of this formeither directly or indirectly through the complex laws of growth. natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one species exclusively for the good of another species though throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of and profits by the structure of another. but natural selection can and does often produce structures for the direct injury of other species as we see in the fang of the adder and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon by which its eggs are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. if it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species it would annihilate my theory for such could not have been produced through natural selection. although many statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect i cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. it is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poisonfang for its own defence and for the destruction of its prey but some authors suppose that at the same time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury namely to warn its prey to escape. i would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring in order to warn the doomed mouse. but i have not space here to enter on this and other such cases. natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to itself for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each. no organ will be formed as paley has remarked for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor. if a fair balance be struck between the good and evil caused by each part each will be found on the whole advantageous. after the lapse of time under changing conditions of life if any part comes to be injurious it will be modified or if it be not so the being will become extinct as myriads have become extinct. natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country with which it has to struggle for existence. and we see that this is the degree of perfection attained under nature. the endemic productions of new zealand for instance are perfect one compared with another but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from europe. natural selection will not produce absolute perfection nor do we always meet as far as we can judge with this high standard under nature. the correction for the aberration of light is said on high authority not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ the eye. if our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature this same reason tells us though we may easily err on both sides that some other contrivances are less perfect. can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect which when used against many attacking animals cannot be withdrawn owing to the backward serratures and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera? if we look at the sting of the bee as having originally existed in a remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument like that in so many members of the same great order and which has been modified but not perfected for its present purpose with the poison originally adapted to cause galls subsequently intensified we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the insects own death for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection though it may cause the death of some few members. if we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their females can we admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones which are utterly useless to the community for any other end and which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? it may be difficult but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queenbee which urges her instantly to destroy the young queens her daughters as soon as born or to perish herself in the combat for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community and maternal love or maternal hatred though the latter fortunately is most rare is all the same to the inexorable principle of natural selection. if we admire the several ingenious contrivances by which the flowers of the orchis and of many other plants are fertilised through insect agency can we consider as equally perfect the elaboration by our firtrees of dense clouds of pollen in order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the ovules? difficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory. many of them are very grave but i think that in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts which on the theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure. we have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow and will act at any one time only on a very few forms and partly because the very process of natural selection almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations. closely allied species now living on a continuous area must often have been formed when the area was not continuous and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another. when two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area an intermediate variety will often be formed fitted for an intermediate zone but from reasons assigned the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it connects consequently the two latter during the course of further modification from existing in greater numbers will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it. that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each other that a bat for instance could not have been formed by natural selection from an animal which at first could only glide through the air. we have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its habits or have diversified habits with some habits very unlike those of its nearest congeners. hence we can understand bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet ground woodpeckers diving thrushes and petrels with the habits of auks. although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been formed by natural selection is more than enough to stagger any one yet in the case of any organ if we know of a long series of gradations in complexity each good for its possessor then under changing conditions of life there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. in the cases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states we should be very cautious in concluding that none could have existed for the homologies of many organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses in function are at least possible. for instance a swimbladder has apparently been converted into an airbreathing lung. the same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions and then having been specialised for one function and two very distinct organs having performed at the same time the same function the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other must often have largely facilitated transitions. we are far too ignorant in almost every case to be enabled to assert that any part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection. but we may confidently believe that many modifications wholly due to the laws of growth and at first in no way advantageous to a species have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this species. we may also believe that a part formerly of high importance has often been retained as the tail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants though it has become of such small importance that it could not in its present state have been acquired by natural selectiona power which acts solely by the preservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life. natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive good or injury of another though it may well produce parts organs and excretions highly useful or even indispensable or highly injurious to another species but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner. natural selection in each wellstocked country must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another and consequently will produce perfection or strength in the battle for life only according to the standard of that country. hence the inhabitants of one country generally the smaller one will often yield as we see they do yield to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country. for in the larger country there will have existed more individuals and more diversified forms and the competition will have been severer and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher. natural selection will not necessarily produce absolute perfection nor as far as we can judge by our limited faculties can absolute perfection be everywhere found. on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history natura non facit saltum. this canon if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world is not strictly correct but if we include all those of past times it must by my theory be strictly true. it is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great lawsunity of type and the conditions of existence. by unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see in organic beings of the same class and which is quite independent of their habits of life. on my theory unity of type is explained by unity of descent. the expression of conditions of existence so often insisted on by the illustrious cuvier is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection. for natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life or by having adapted them during longpast periods of time the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth. hence in fact the law of the conditions of existence is the higher law as it includes through the inheritance of former adaptations that of unity of type.   instinct.  instincts comparable with habits but different in their origin. instincts graduated. aphides and ants. instincts variable. domestic instincts their origin. natural instincts of the cuckoo ostrich and parasitic bees. slavemaking ants. hivebee its

separately especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hivebee making its cells will probably have occurred to many readers as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory. i must premise that i have nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers any more than i have with that of life itself. we are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within the same class. i will not attempt any definition of instinct. it would be easy to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term but every one understands what is meant when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds nests. an action which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to perform when performed by an animal more especially by a very young one without any experience and when performed by many individuals in the same way without their knowing for what purpose it is performed is usually said to be instinctive. but i could show that none of these characters of instinct are universal. a little dose as pierre huber expresses it of judgment or reason often comes into play even in animals very low in the scale of nature. frederick cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit. this comparison gives i think a remarkably accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed but not of its origin. how unconsciously many habitual actions are performed indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. habits easily become associated with other habits and with certain periods of time and states of the body. when once acquired they often remain constant throughout life. several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits could be pointed out. as in repeating a wellknown song so in instincts one action follows another by a sort of rhythm if a person be interrupted in a song or in repeating anything by rote he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought so p. huber found it was with a caterpillar which makes a very complicated hammock for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to say the sixth stage of construction and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage the caterpillar simply reperformed the fourth fifth and sixth stages of construction. if however a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up for instance to the third stage and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage so that much of its work was already done for it far from feeling the benefit of this it was much embarrassed and in order to complete its hammock seemed forced to start from the third stage where it had left off and thus tried to complete the already finished work.  if we suppose any habitual action to become inheritedand i think it can be shown that this does sometimes happenthen the resemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be distinguished. if mozart instead of playing the pianoforte at three years old with wonderfully little practice had played a tune with no practice at all he might truly be said to have done so instinctively. but it would be the most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations. it can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted namely those of the hivebee and of many ants could not possibly have been thus acquired. it will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as corporeal structure for the welfare of each species under its present conditions of life. under changed conditions of life it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a species and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little then i can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable. it is thus as i believe that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated. as modifications of corporeal structure arise from and are increased by use or habit and are diminished or lost by disuse so i do not doubt it has been with instincts. but i believe that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of instinctsthat is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure. no complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous slight yet profitable variations. hence as in the case of corporeal structures we ought to find in nature not the actual transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been acquiredfor these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of each speciesbut we ought to find in the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations or we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible and this we certainly can do. i have been surprised to find making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in europe and north america and for no instinct being known amongst extinct species how very generally gradations leading to the most complex instincts can be discovered. the canon of natura non facit saltum applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodily organs. changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts at different periods of life or at different seasons of the year or when placed under different circumstances etc. in which case either one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection. and such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature. again as in the case of corporeal structure and conformably with my theory the instinct of each species is good for itself but has never as far as we can judge been produced for the exclusive good of others. one of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another with which i am acquainted is that of aphides voluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants that they do so voluntarily the following facts show. i removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dockplant and prevented their attendance during several hours. after this interval i felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete. i watched them for some time through a lens but not one excreted i then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner as well as i could as the ants do with their antenn but not one excreted. afterwards i allowed an ant to visit them and it immediately seemed by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered it then began to play with its antenn on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each aphis as soon as it felt the antenn immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerly devoured by the ant. even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner showing that the action was instinctive and not the result of experience. but as the excretion is extremely viscid it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it removed and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete for the sole good of the ants. although i do not believe that any animal in the world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a distinct species yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts of others as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of others. so again in some few cases certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect but as details on this and other such points are not indispensable they may be here passed over. as some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature and the inheritance of such variations are indispensable for the action of natural selection as many instances as possible ought to have been here given but want of space prevents me. i can only assert that instincts certainly do varyfor instance the migratory instinct both in extent and direction and in its total loss. so it is with the nests of birds which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen and on the nature and temperature of the country inhabited but often from causes wholly unknown to us audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in nests of the same species in the northern and southern united states. fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality as may be seen in nestling birds though it is strengthened by experience and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals. but fear of man is slowly acquired as i have elsewhere shown by various animals inhabiting desert islands and we may see an instance of this even in england in the greater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds for the large birds have been most persecuted by man. we may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small and the magpie so wary in england is tame in norway as is the hooded crow in egypt. that the general disposition of individuals of the same species born in a state of nature is extremely diversified can be shown by a multitude of facts. several cases also could be given of occasional and strange habits in certain species which might if advantageous to the species give rise through natural selection to quite new instincts. but i am well aware that these general statements without facts given in detail can produce but a feeble effect on the readers mind. i can only repeat my assurance that i do not speak without good evidence. the possibility or even probability of inherited variations of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few cases under domestication. we shall thus also be enabled to see the respective parts which habit and the selection of socalled accidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic animals. a number of curious and authentic instances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes and likewise of the oddest tricks associated with certain frames of mind or periods of time. but let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds of dogs it cannot be doubted that young pointers i have myself seen a striking instance will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers and a tendency to run round instead of at a flock of sheep by shepherddogs. i cannot see that these actions performed without experience by the young and in nearly the same manner by each individual performed with eager delight by each breed and without the end being knownfor the young pointer can no more know that he points to aid his master than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbagei cannot see that these actions differ essentially from true instincts. if we were to see one kind of wolf when young and without any training as soon as it scented its prey stand motionless like a statue and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait and another kind of wolf rushing round instead of at a herd of deer and driving them to a distant point we should assuredly call these actions instinctive. domestic instincts as they may be called are certainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts but they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection and have been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period under less fixed conditions of life. how strongly these domestic instincts habits and dispositions are inherited and how curiously they become mingled is well shown when different breeds of dogs are crossed. thus it is known that a cross with a bulldog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of shepherddogs a tendency to hunt hares. these domestic instincts when thus tested by crossing resemble natural instincts which in a like manner become curiously blended together and for a long period exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent for example le roy describes a dog whose greatgrandfather was a wolf and this dog showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way by not coming in a straight line to his master when called. domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become inherited solely from longcontinued and compulsory habit but this i think is not true. no one would ever have thought of teaching or probably could have taught the tumblerpigeon to tumblean action which as i have witnessed is performed by young birds that have never seen a pigeon tumble. we may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to this strange habit and that the longcontinued selection of the best individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are and near glasgow there are housetumblers as i hear from mr. brent which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. it may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line and this is known occasionally to happen as i once saw in a pure terrier. when the first tendency was once displayed methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the work and unconscious selection is still at work as each man tries to procure without intending to improve the breed dogs which will stand and hunt best. on the other hand habit alone in some cases has sufficed no animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit but i do not suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness and i presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness simply to habit and longcontinued close confinement. natural instincts are lost under domestication a remarkable instance of this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become broody that is never wish to sit on their eggs. familiarity alone prevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic animals have been modified by domestication. it is scarcely possible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. all wolves foxes jackals and species of the cat genus when kept tame are most eager to attack poultry sheep and pigs and this tendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries such as tierra del fuego and australia where the savages do not keep these domestic animals. how rarely on the other hand do our civilised dogs even when quite young require to be taught not to attack poultry sheep and pigs! no doubt they occasionally do make an attack and are then beaten and if not cured they are destroyed so that habit with some degree of selection has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs. on the other hand young chickens have lost wholly by habit that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in young pheasants though reared under a hen. it is not that chickens have lost all fear but fear only of dogs and cats for if the hen gives the dangerchuckle they will run more especially young turkeys from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing as we see in wild groundbirds their mother to fly away. but this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under domestication for the motherhen has almost lost by disuse the power of flight. hence we may conclude that domestic instincts have been acquired and natural instincts have been lost partly by habit and partly by man selecting and accumulating during successive generations peculiar mental habits and actions which at first appeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident. in some cases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing and all has been the result of selection pursued both methodically and unconsciously but in most cases probably habit and selection have acted together. we shall perhaps best understand how instincts in a state of nature have become modified by selection by considering a few cases. i will select only three out of the several which i shall have to discuss in my future worknamely the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds nests the slavemaking instinct of certain ants and the combmaking power of the hivebee these two latter instincts have generally and most justly been ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known instincts. it is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the cuckoos instinct is that she lays her eggs not daily but at intervals of two or three days so that if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest. if this were the case the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long more especially as she has to migrate at a very early period and the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone. but the american cuckoo is in this predicament for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched all at the same time. it has been asserted that the american cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds nests but i hear on the high authority of dr. brewer that this is a mistake. nevertheless i could give several instances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds nests. now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our european cuckoo had the habits of the american cuckoo but that occasionally she laid an egg in another birds nest. if the old bird profited by this occasional habit or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird than by their own mothers care encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage. and analogy would lead me to believe that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother and in their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds nests and thus be successful in rearing their young. by a continued process of this nature i believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be and has been generated. i may add that according to dr. gray and to some other observers the european cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and care for her own offspring. the occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds nests either of the same or of a distinct species is not very uncommon with the gallinace and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in the allied group of ostriches. for several hen ostriches at least in the case of the american species unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest and then in another and these are hatched by the males. this instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of eggs but as in the case of the cuckoo at intervals of two or three days. this instinct however of the american ostrich has not as yet been perfected for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains so that in one days hunting i picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs. many bees are parasitic and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of other kinds. this case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo for these bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits for they do not possess the pollencollecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store food for their own young. some species likewise of sphegid wasplike insects are parasitic on other species and m. fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although the tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larv to feed on yet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex it takes advantage of the prize and becomes for the occasion parasitic. in this case as with the supposed case of the cuckoo i can see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit permanent if of advantage to the species and if the insect whose nest and stored food are thus feloniously appropriated be not thus exterminated. slavemaking instinct.this remarkable instinct was first discovered in the formica polyerges rufescens by pierre huber a better observer even than his celebrated father. this ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves without their aid the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. the males and fertile females do no work. the workers or sterile females though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves do no other work. they are incapable of making their own nests or of feeding their own larv. when the old nest is found inconvenient and they have to migrate it is the slaves which determine the migration and actually carry their masters in their jaws. so utterly helpless are the masters that when huber shut up thirty of them without a slave but with plenty of the food which they like best and with their larv and pup to stimulate them to work they did nothing they could not even feed themselves and many perished of hunger. huber then introduced a single slave f. fusca and she instantly set to work fed and saved the survivors made some cells and tended the larv and put all to rights. what can be more extraordinary than these wellascertained facts? if we had not known of any other slavemaking ant it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected. formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by p. huber to be a slavemaking ant. this species is found in the southern parts of england and its habits have been attended to by mr. f. smith of the british museum to whom i am much indebted for information on this and other subjects. although fully trusting to the statements of huber and mr. smith i tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves. hence i will give the observations which i have myself made in some little detail. i opened fourteen nests of f. sanguinea and found a few slaves in all. males and fertile females of the slavespecies are found only in their own proper communities and have never been observed in the nests of f. sanguinea. the slaves are black and not above half the size of their red masters so that the contrast in their appearance is very great. when the nest is slightly disturbed the slaves occasionally come out and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest when the nest is much disturbed and the larv and pup are exposed the slaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety. hence it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home. during the months of june and july on three successive years i have watched for many hours several nests in surrey and sussex and never saw a slave either leave or enter a nest. as during these months the slaves are very few in number i thought that they might behave differently when more numerous but mr. smith informs me that he has watched the nests at various hours during may june and august both in surrey and hampshire and has never seen the slaves though present in large numbers in august either leave or enter the nest. hence he considers them as strictly household slaves. the masters on the other hand may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest and food of all kinds. during the present year however in the month of july i came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves and i observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest and marching along the same road to a tall scotchfirtree twentyfive yards distant which they ascended together probably in search of aphides or cocci. according to huber who had ample opportunities for observation in switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening and as huber expressly states their principal office is to search for aphides. this difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two countries probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in switzerland than in england. one day i fortunately chanced to witness a migration from one nest to another and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters carefully carrying as huber has described their slaves in their jaws. another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slavemakers haunting the same spot and evidently not in search of food they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species f. fusca sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slavemaking f. sanguinea. the latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest twentynine yards distant but they were prevented from getting any pup to rear as slaves. i then dug up a small parcel of the pup of f. fusca from another nest and put them down on a bare spot near the place of combat they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants who perhaps fancied that after all they had been victorious in their late combat.  at the same time i laid on the same place a small parcel of the pup of another species f. flava with a few of these little yellow ants still clinging to the fragments of the nest. this species is sometimes though rarely made into slaves as has been described by mr. smith. although so small a species it is very courageous and i have seen it ferociously attack other ants. in one instance i found to my surprise an independent community of f. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slavemaking f. sanguinea and when i had accidentally disturbed both nests the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage. now i was curious to ascertain whether f. sanguinea could distinguish the pup of f. fusca which they habitually make into slaves from those of the little and furious f. flava which they rarely capture and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pup of f. fusca whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pup or even the earth from the nest of f. flava and quickly ran away but in about a quarter of an hour shortly after all the little yellow ants had crawled away they took heart and carried off the pup. one evening i visited another community of f. sanguinea and found a number of these ants entering their nest carrying the dead bodies of f. fusca showing that it was not a migration and numerous pup. i traced the returning file burthened with booty for about forty yards to a very thick clump of heath whence i saw the last individual of f. sanguinea emerge carrying a pupa but i was not able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath. the nest however must have been close at hand for two or three individuals of f. fusca were rushing about in the greatest agitation and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath over its ravaged home. such are the facts though they did not need confirmation by me in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. let it be observed what a contrast the instinctive habits of f. sanguinea present with those of the f. rufescens. the latter does not build its own nest does not determine its own migrations does not collect food for itself or its young and cannot even feed itself it is absolutely dependent on its numerous slaves. formica sanguinea on the other hand possesses much fewer slaves and in the early part of the summer extremely few. the masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed and when they migrate the masters carry the slaves. both in switzerland and england the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larv and the masters alone go on slavemaking expeditions. in switzerland the slaves and masters work together making and bringing materials for the nest both but chiefly the slaves tend and milk as it may be called their aphides and thus both collect food for the community. in england the masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials and food for themselves their slaves and larv. so that the masters in this country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in switzerland. by what steps the instinct of f. sanguinea originated i will not pretend to conjecture. but as ants which are not slavemakers will as i have seen carry off pup of other species if scattered near their nests it is possible that pup originally stored as food might become developed and the ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their proper instincts and do what work they could. if their presence proved useful to the species which had seized themif it were more advantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate themthe habit of collecting pup originally for food might by natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of raising slaves. when the instinct was once acquired if carried out to a much less extent even than in our british f. sanguinea which as we have seen is less aided by its slaves than the same species in switzerland i can see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the instinctalways supposing each modification to be of use to the speciesuntil an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is the formica rufescens. cellmaking instinct of the hivebee.i will not here enter on minute details on this subject but will merely give an outline of the conclusions at which i have arrived. he must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb so beautifully adapted to its end without enthusiastic admiration. we hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction. it has been remarked that a skilful workman with fitting tools and measures would find it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form though this is perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. grant whatever instincts you please and it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and planes or even perceive when they are correctly made. but the difficulty is not nearly so great as it at first appears all this beautiful work can be shown i think to follow from a few very simple instincts.  i was led to investigate this subject by mr. waterhouse who has shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells and the following view may perhaps be considered only as a modification of his theory. let us look to the great principle of gradation and see whether nature does not reveal to us her method of work. at one end of a short series we have humblebees which use their old cocoons to hold honey sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. at the other end of the series we have the cells of the hivebee placed in a double layer each cell as is well known is an hexagonal prism with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join on to a pyramid formed of three rhombs. these rhombs have certain angles and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. in the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hivebee and the simplicity of those of the humblebee we have the cells of the mexican melipona domestica carefully described and figured by pierre huber. the melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee but more nearly related to the latter it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells in which the young are hatched and in addition some large cells of wax for holding honey. these latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes and are aggregated into an irregular mass. but the important point to notice is that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been completed but this is never permitted the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect. hence each cell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two three or more perfectly flat surfaces according as the cell adjoins two three or more other cells. when one cell comes into contact with three other cells which from the spheres being nearly of the same size is very frequently and necessarily the case the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid and this pyramid as huber has remarked is manifestly a gross imitation of the threesided pyramidal basis of the cell of the hivebee. as in the cells of the hivebee so here the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells. it is obvious that the melipona saves wax by this manner of building for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells. reflecting on this case it occurred to me that if the melipona had made its spheres at some given distance from each other and had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer the resulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the hivebee. accordingly i wrote to professor miller of cambridge and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement drawn up from his information and tells me that it is strictly correct if a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two parallel layers with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius x the square root of 2 or radius x 1.41421 or at some lesser distance from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer then if planes of intersection between the several spheres in both layers be formed there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the cells of the hivebee. hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the melipona and in themselves not very wonderful this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the hivebee. we must suppose the melipona to make her cells truly spherical and of equal sizes and this would not be very surprising seeing that she already does so to a certain extent and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects can make apparently by turning round on a fixed point. we must suppose the melipona to arrange her cells in level layers as she already does her cylindrical cells and we must further suppose and this is the greatest difficulty that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellowlabourers when several are making their spheres but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces. we have further to suppose but this is no difficulty that after hexagonal prisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of honey in the same way as the rude humblebee adds cylinders of wax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons. by such modifications of instincts in themselves not very wonderfulhardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to make its nesti believe that the hivebee has acquired through natural selection her inimitable architectural powers. but this theory can be tested by experiment. following the example of mr. tegetmeier i separated two combs and put between them a long thick square strip of wax the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it and as they deepened these little pits they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere and of about the diameter of a cell. it was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together they had begun their work at such a distance from each other that by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width i.e. about the width of an ordinary cell and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other. as soon as this occurred the bees ceased to excavate and began to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin instead of on the straight edges of a threesided pyramid as in the case of ordinary cells. i then put into the hive instead of a thick square piece of wax a thin and narrow knifeedged ridge coloured with vermilion. the bees instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other in the same way as before but the ridge of wax was so thin that the bottoms of the basins if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former experiment would have broken into each other from the opposite sides. the bees however did not suffer this to happen and they stopped their excavations in due time so that the basins as soon as they had been a little deepened came to have flat bottoms and these flat bottoms formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left ungnawed were situated as far as the eye could judge exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides of the ridge of wax. in parts only little bits in other parts large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins but the work from the unnatural state of things had not been neatly performed. the bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax as they circularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides in order to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins by stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection. considering how flexible thin wax is i do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness and then stopping their work. in ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides for i have noticed halfcompleted rhombs at the base of a justcommenced cell which were slightly concave on one side where i suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly. in one wellmarked instance i put the comb back into the hive and allowed the bees to go on working for a short time and again examined the cell and i found that the rhombic plate had been completed and had become perfectly flat it was absolutely impossible from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic plate that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side and i suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax which as i have tried is easily done into its proper intermediate plane and thus flatten it. from the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can clearly see that if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax they could make their cells of the proper shape by standing at the proper distance from each other by excavating at the same rate and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows but never allowing the spheres to break into each other. now bees as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb do make a rough circumferential wall or rim all round the comb and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides always working circularly as they deepen each cell. they do not make the whole threesided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin or the two plates as the case may be and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates until the hexagonal walls are commenced. some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated elder huber but i am convinced of their accuracy and if i had space i could show that they are conformable with my theory. hubers statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little parallelsided wall of wax is not as far as i have seen strictly correct the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax but i will not here enter on these details. we see how important a part excavation plays in the construction of the cells but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper positionthat is along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres. i have several specimens showing clearly that they can do this. even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a growing comb flexures may sometimes be observed corresponding in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. but the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off by being largely gnawed away on both sides. the manner in which the bees build is curious they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell which will ultimately be left. we shall understand how they work by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground till a smooth very thin wall is left in the middle the masons always piling up the cutaway cement and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge. we shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crowned by a gigantic coping. from all the cells both those just commenced and those completed being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls which are only about one fourhundredth of an inch in thickness the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick. by this singular manner of building strength is continually given to the comb with the utmost ultimate economy of wax. it seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells are made that a multitude of bees all work together one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another so that as huber has stated a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell. i was able practically to show this fact by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax and i invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by the beesas delicately as a painter could have done with his brushby atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed and worked into the growing edges of the cells all round. the work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other all trying to sweep equal spheres and then building up or leaving ungnawed the planes of intersection between these spheres. it was really curious to note in cases of difficulty as when two pieces of comb met at an angle how often the bees would entirely pull down and rebuild in different ways the same cell sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected. when bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions for workingfor instance on a slip of wood placed directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over one face of the slipin this case the bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon in its strictly proper place projecting beyond the other completed cells. it suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the last completed cells and then by striking imaginary spheres they can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres but as far as i have seen they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of the adjoining cells has been built. this capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place between two justcommenced cells is important as it bears on a fact which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory namely that the cells on the extreme margin of waspcombs are sometimes strictly hexagonal but i have not space here to enter on this subject. nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect as in the case of a queenwasp making hexagonal cells if she work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same time always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun sweeping spheres or cylinders and building up intermediate planes. it is even conceivable that an insect might by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell and then moving outside first to one point and then to five other points at the proper relative distances from the central point and from each other strike the planes of intersection and so make an isolated hexagon but i am not aware that any such case has been observed nor would any good be derived from a single hexagon being built as in its construction more materials would be required than for a cylinder. as natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life it may reasonably be asked how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction could have profited the progenitors of the hivebee? i think the answer is not difficult it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar and i am informed by mr. tegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound of wax so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs. moreover many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion. a large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported. hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family of bees. of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies or on quite distinct causes and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees could collect. but let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined as it probably often does determine the numbers of a humblebee which could exist in a country and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter and consequently required a store of honey there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humblebee if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together so as to intersect a little for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little wax. hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humblebee if she were to make her cells more and more regular nearer together and aggregated into a mass like the cells of the melipona for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells and much wax would be saved. again from the same cause it would be advantageous to the melipona if she were to make her cells closer together and more regular in every way than at present for then as we have seen the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and would all be replaced by plane surfaces and the melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hivebee. beyond this stage of perfection in architecture natural selection could not lead for the comb of the hivebee as far as we can see is absolutely perfect in economising wax. thus as i believe the most wonderful of all known instincts that of the hivebee can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous successive slight modifications of simpler instincts natural selection having by slow degrees more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection. the bees of course no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates. the motive power of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax that individual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax having succeeded best and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to new swarms which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence. no doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selectioncases in which we cannot see how an instinct could possibly have originated cases in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist cases of instinct of apparently such trifling importance that they could hardly have been acted on by natural selection cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their similarity by inheritance from a common parent and must therefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. i will not here enter on these several cases but will confine myself to one special difficulty which at first appeared to me insuperable and actually fatal to my whole theory. i allude to the neuters or sterile females in insectcommunities for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and fertile females and yet from being sterile they cannot propagate their kind. the subject well deserves to be discussed at great length but i will here take only a single case that of working or sterile ants. how the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile and if such insects had been social and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work but incapable of procreation i can see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural selection. but i must pass over this preliminary difficulty. the great difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in structure as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes and in instinct. as far as instinct alone is concerned the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers and the perfect females would have been far better exemplified by the hivebee. if a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal in the ordinary state i should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection namely by an individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of structure this being inherited by its offspring which again varied and were again selected and so onwards. but with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its parents yet absolutely sterile so that it could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its progeny. it may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection? first let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature of all sorts of differences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages and to either sex. we have differences correlated not only to one sex but to that short period alone when the reproductive system is active as in the nuptial plumage of many birds and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon. we have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds. hence i can see no real difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insectcommunities the difficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection. this difficulty though appearing insuperable is lessened or as i believe disappears when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family as well as to the individual and may thus gain the desired end. thus a wellflavoured vegetable is cooked and the individual is destroyed but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together the animal has been slaughtered but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family. i have such faith in the powers of selection that i do not doubt that a breed of cattle always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns could be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows when matched produced oxen with the longest horns and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind. thus i believe it has been with social insects a slight modification of structure or instinct correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community has been advantageous to the community consequently the fertile males and females of the same community flourished and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same modification. and i believe that this process has been repeated until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced which we see in many social insects. but we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty namely the fact that the neuters of several ants differ not only from the fertile females and males but from each other sometimes to an almost incredible degree and are thus divided into two or even three castes. the castes moreover do not generally graduate into each other but are perfectly well defined being as distinct from each other as are any two species of the same genus or rather as any two genera of the same family. thus in eciton there are working and soldier neuters with jaws and instincts extraordinarily different in cryptocerus the workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads the use of which is quite unknown in the mexican myrmecocystus the workers of one caste never leave the nest they are fed by the workers of another caste and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides or the domestic cattle as they may be called which our european ants guard or imprison. it will indeed be thought that i have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection when i do not admit that such wonderful and wellestablished facts at once annihilate my theory. in the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind which have been rendered by natural selection as i believe to be quite possible different from the fertile males and femalesin this case we may safely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations that each successive slight profitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the individual neuters in the same nest but in a few alone and that by the longcontinued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters with the profitable modification all the neuters ultimately came to have the desired character. on this view we ought occasionally to find neuterinsects of the same species in the same nest presenting gradations of structure and this we do find even often considering how few neuterinsects out of europe have been carefully examined. mr. f. smith has shown how surprisingly the neuters of several british ants differ from each other in size and sometimes in colour and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest i have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. it often happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous or that both large and small are numerous with those of an intermediate size scanty in numbers. formica flava has larger and smaller workers with some of intermediate size and in this species as mr. f. smith has observed the larger workers have simple eyes ocelli which though small can be plainly distinguished whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary. having carefully dissected several specimens of these workers i can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally lesser size and i fully believe though i dare not assert so positively that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition. so that we here have two bodies of sterile workers in the same nest differing not only in size but in their organs of vision yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. i may digress by adding that if the smaller workers had been the most useful to the community and those males and females had been continually selected which produced more and more of the smaller workers until all the workers had come to be in this condition we should then have had a species of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of myrmica. for the workers of myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli though the male and female ants of this genus have welldeveloped ocelli. i may give one other case so confidently did i expect to find gradations in important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in the same species that i gladly availed myself of mr. f. smiths offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant anomma of west africa. the reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these workers by my giving not the actual measurements but a strictly accurate illustration the difference was the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four inches high and many sixteen feet high but we must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men and jaws nearly five times as big. the jaws moreover of the working ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape and in the form and number of the teeth. but the important fact for us is that though the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes yet they graduate insensibly into each other as does the widelydifferent structure of their jaws. i speak confidently on this latter point as mr. lubbock made drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which i had dissected from the workers of the several sizes. with these facts before me i believe that natural selection by acting on the fertile parents could form a species which should regularly produce neuters either all of large size with one form of jaw or all of small size with jaws having a widely different structure or lastly and this is our climax of difficulty one set of workers of one size and structure and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structurea graduated series having been first formed as in the case of the driver ant and then the extreme forms from being the most useful to the community having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the natural selection of the parents which generated them until none with an intermediate structure were produced. thus as i believe the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest both widely different from each other and from their parents has originated. we can see how useful their production may have been to a social community of insects on the same principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man. as ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited tools or weapons and not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments a perfect division of labour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile for had they been fertile they would have intercrossed and their instincts and structure would have become blended. and nature has as i believe effected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants by the means of natural selection. but i am bound to confess that with all my faith in this principle i should never have anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in so high a degree had not the case of these neuter insects convinced me of the fact. i have therefore discussed this case at some little but wholly insufficient length in order to show the power of natural selection and likewise because this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my theory has encountered. the case also is very interesting as it proves that with animals as with plants any amount of modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation of numerous slight and as we must call them accidental variations which are in any manner profitable without exercise or habit having come into play. for no amount of exercise or habit or volition in the utterly sterile members of a community could possibly have affected the structure or instincts of the fertile members which alone leave descendants. i am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects against the wellknown doctrine of lamarck. mental qualities of our domestic animals vary and that the variations are inherited. still more briefly i have attempted to show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature. no one will dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each animal. therefore i can see no difficulty under changing conditions of life in natural selection accumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent in any useful direction. in some cases habit or use and disuse have probably strengthen in any great degree my theory but none of the cases of difficulty to the best of my judgment annihilate it. on the other hand the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to mistakesthat no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of other animals but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of othersthat the canon in natural history of natura non facit saltum is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views but is otherwise inexplicableall tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection. this theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard to instincts as by that common case of closely allied but certainly distinct species when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under considerably different conditions of life yet often retaining nearly the same instincts. for instance we can understand on the principle of inheritance how it is that the thrush of south america lines its nest with mud in the same peculiar manner as does our british thrush how it is that the male wrens troglodytes of north america build cocknests to roost in like the males of our distinct kittywrensa habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird. finally it may not be a logical deduction but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its fosterbrothersants making slavesthe larv of ichneumonid feeding within the live bodies of caterpillarsnot as specially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely multiply vary let the strongest live and the weakest die.   hybridism.  distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. sterility various in degree not universal affected by close interbreeding removed by

between the effects of changed conditions of life and crossing. fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring not universal. hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their

organic forms. this view certainly seems at first probable for species within the same country could hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely. the importance of the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile has i think been much underrated by some late writers. on the theory of natural selection the case is especially important inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage to them and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. i hope however to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired or endowed quality but is incidental on other acquired differences. in treating this subject two classes of facts to a large extent fundamentally different have generally been confounded together namely the sterility of two species when first crossed and the sterility of the hybrids produced from them. pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect condition yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring. hybrids on the other hand have their reproductive organs functionally impotent as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both plants and animals though the organs themselves are perfect in structure as far as the microscope reveals. in the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect in the second case they are either not at all developed or are imperfectly developed. this distinction is important when the cause of the sterility which is common to the two cases has to be considered. the distinction has probably been slurred over owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment beyond the province of our reasoning powers. the fertility of varieties that is of the forms known or believed to have descended from common parents when intercrossed and likewise the fertility of their mongrel offspring is on my theory of equal importance with the sterility of species for it seems to make a broad and clear distinction between varieties and species. first for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid offspring. it is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable observers klreuter and grtner who almost devoted their lives to this subject without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility. klreuter makes the rule universal but then he cuts the knot for in ten cases in which he found two forms considered by most authors as distinct species quite fertile together he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties. grtner also makes the rule equally universal and he disputes the entire fertility of klreuters ten cases. but in these and in many other cases grtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds in order to show that there is any degree of sterility. he always compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring with the average number produced by both pure parentspecies in a state of nature. but a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced a plant to be hybridised must be castrated and what is often more important must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants. nearly all the plants experimentised on by grtner were potted and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house. that these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted for grtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated and artificially fertilised with their own pollen and excluding all cases such as the leguminos in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation half of these twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired. moreover as grtner during several years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip which we have such good reason to believe to be varieties and only once or twice succeeded in getting fertile seed as he found the common red and blue pimpernels anagallis arvensis and coerulea which the best botanists rank as varieties absolutely sterile together and as he came to the same conclusion in several other analogous cases it seems to me that we may well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so sterile when intercrossed as grtner believes.  it is certain on the one hand that the sterility of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly and on the other hand that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by various circumstances that for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins. i think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived namely klreuter and grtner should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same species. it is also most instructive to comparebut i have not space here to enter on detailsthe evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers or by the same author from experiments made during different years. it can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between species and varieties but that the evidence from this source graduates away and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences. in regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations though grtner was enabled to rear some hybrids carefully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent for six or seven and in one case for ten generations yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increased but generally greatly decreased. i do not doubt that this is usually the case and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the first few generations. nevertheless i believe that in all these experiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause namely from close interbreeding. i have collected so large a body of facts showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility and on the other hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases fertility that i cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal belief amongst breeders. hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers and as the parentspecies or other allied hybrids generally grow in the same garden the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season hence hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen and i am convinced that this would be injurious to their fertility already lessened by their hybrid origin. i am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by grtner namely that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind their fertility notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation sometimes decidedly increases and goes on increasing. now in artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance as i know from my own experience from the anthers of another flower as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised so that a cross between two flowers though probably on the same plant would be thus effected. moreover whenever complicated experiments are in progress so careful an observer as grtner would have castrated his hybrids and this would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen from a distinct flower either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature. and thus the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids may i believe be accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided. now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced hybridiser namely the honourable and reverend w. herbert. he is as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertileas fertile as the pure parentspeciesas are klreuter and grtner that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. he experimentised on some of the very same species as did grtner. the difference in their results may i think be in part accounted for by herberts great horticultural skill and by his having hothouses at his command. of his many important statements i will here give only a single one as an example namely that every ovule in a pod of crinum capense fertilised by c. revolutum produced a plant which he says i never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation. so that we here have perfect or even more than commonly perfect fertility in a first cross between two distinct species. this case of the crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact namely that there are individual plants as with certain species of lobelia and with all the species of the genus hippeastrum which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct species than by their own pollen. for these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen of a distinct species though quite sterile with their own pollen notwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good for it fertilised distinct species. so that certain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be selffertilised! for instance a bulb of hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers three were fertilised by herbert with their own pollen and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct species the result was that the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow and after a few days perished entirely whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to maturity and bore good seed which vegetated freely. in a letter to me in 1839 mr. herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment during five years and he continued to try it during several subsequent years and always with the same result. this result has also been confirmed by other observers in the case of hippeastrum with its subgenera and in the case of some other genera as lobelia passiflora and verbascum. although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly healthy and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were perfectly good with respect to other species yet as they were functionally imperfect in their mutual selfaction we must infer that the plants were in an unnatural state. nevertheless these facts show on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed in comparison with the same species when selffertilised sometimes depends. the practical experiments of horticulturists though not made with scientific precision deserve some notice. it is notorious in how complicated a manner the species of pelargonium fuchsia calceolaria petunia rhododendron etc. have been crossed yet many of these hybrids seed freely. for instance herbert asserts that a hybrid from calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea species most widely dissimilar in general habit reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species from the mountains of chile. i have taken some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of rhododendrons and i am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile. mr. c. noble for instance informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between rhododendron ponticum and catawbiense and that this hybrid seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine. had hybrids when fairly treated gone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation as grtner believes to be the case the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen. horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids and such alone are fairly treated for by insect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented. any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of insectagency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons which produce no pollen for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers. in regard to animals much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than with plants. if our systematic arrangements can be trusted that is if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the genera of plants then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants but the hybrids themselves are i think more sterile. i doubt whether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well authenticated. it should however be borne in mind that owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement few experiments have been fairly tried for instance the canarybird has been crossed with nine other finches but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary or that their hybrids should be perfectly fertile. again with respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals i hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. on the contrary brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. and in this case it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing. if we were to act thus and pair brothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal which from any cause had the least tendency to sterility the breed would assuredly be lost in a very few generations. although i do not know of any thoroughly wellauthenticated cases of perfectly fertile hybrid animals i have some reason to believe that the hybrids from cervulus vaginalis and reevesii and from phasianus colchicus with p. torquatus and with p. versicolor are perfectly fertile. the hybrids from the common and chinese geese a. cygnoides species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera have often bred in this country with either pure parent and in one single instance they have bred inter se. this was effected by mr. eyton who raised two hybrids from the same parents but from different hatches and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids grandchildren of the pure geese from one nest. in india however these crossbred geese must be far more fertile for i am assured by two eminently capable judges namely mr. blyth and capt. hutton that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country and as they are kept for profit where neither pure parentspecies exists they must certainly be highly fertile. a doctrine which originated with pallas has been largely accepted by modern naturalists namely that most of our domestic animals have descended from two or more aboriginal species since commingled by intercrossing. on this view the aboriginal species must either at first have produced quite fertile hybrids or the hybrids must have become in subsequent generations quite fertile under domestication. this latter alternative seems to me the most probable and i am inclined to believe in its truth although it rests on no direct evidence. i believe for instance that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks yet with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of south america all are quite fertile together and analogy makes me greatly doubt whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids. so again there is reason to believe that our european and the humped indian cattle are quite fertile together but from facts communicated to me by mr. blyth i think they must be considered as distinct species. on this view of the origin of many of our domestic animals we must either give up the belief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of animals when crossed or we must look at sterility not as an indelible characteristic but as one capable of being removed by domestication. finally looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals it may be concluded that some degree of sterility both in first crosses and in hybridsis an extremely general result but that it cannot under our present state of knowledge be considered as absolutely universal. laws governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.we will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. our chief object will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been endowed with this quality in order to prevent their crossing and blending together in utter confusion. the following rules and conclusions are chiefly drawn up from grtners admirable work on the hybridisation of plants. i have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to animals and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals i have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms. it has been already remarked that the degree of fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids graduates from zero to perfect fertility. it is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. when pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct family it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust. from this absolute zero of fertility the pollen of different species of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility and as we have seen in certain abnormal cases even to an excess of fertility beyond that which the plants own pollen will produce. so in hybrids themselves there are some which never have produced and probably never would produce even with the pollen of either pure parent a single fertile seed but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected by the pollen of one of the pure parentspecies causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation. from this extreme degree of sterility we have selffertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility. hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross and which rarely produce any offspring are generally very sterile but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross and the sterility of the hybrids thus producedtwo classes of facts which are generally confounded togetheris by no means strict. there are many cases in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility and produce numerous hybridoffspring yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. on the other hand there are species which can be crossed very rarely or with extreme difficulty but the hybrids when at last produced are very fertile. even within the limits of the same genus for instance in dianthus these two opposite cases occur. the fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids is more easily affected by unfavourable conditions than is the fertility of pure species. but the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable for it is not always the same when the same two species are crossed under the same circumstances but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment. so it is with hybrids for their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions. by the term systematic affinity is meant the resemblance between species in structure and in constitution more especially in the structure of parts which are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the allied species. now the fertility of first crosses between species and of the hybrids produced from them is largely governed by their systematic affinity. this is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in distinct families and on the other hand by very closely allied species generally uniting with facility. but the correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict. a multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which will not unite or only with extreme difficulty and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. in the same family there may be a genus as dianthus in which very many species can most readily be crossed and another genus as silene in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between extremely close species a single hybrid. even within the limits of the same genus we meet with this same difference for instance the many species of nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus but grtner found that n. acuminata which is not a particularly distinct species obstinately failed to fertilise or to be fertilised by no less than eight other species of nicotiana. very many analogous facts could be given. no one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of difference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species crossing. it can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and general appearance and having strongly marked differences in every part of the flower even in the pollen in the fruit and in the cotyledons can be crossed. annual and perennial plants deciduous and evergreen trees plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for extremely different climates can often be crossed with ease.  by a reciprocal cross between two species i mean the case for instance of a stallionhorse being first crossed with a femaleass and then a maleass with a mare these two species may then be said to have been reciprocally crossed. there is often the widest possible difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. such cases are highly important for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic affinity or of any recognisable difference in their whole organisation. on the other hand these cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with constitutional differences imperceptible by us and confined to the reproductive system. this difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two species was long ago observed by klreuter. to give an instance mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of m. longiflora and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile but klreuter tried more than two hundred times during eight following years to fertilise reciprocally m. longiflora with the pollen of m. jalappa and utterly failed. several other equally striking cases could be given. thuret has observed the same fact with certain seaweeds or fuci. grtner moreover found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. he has observed it even between forms so closely related as matthiola annua and glabra that many botanists rank them only as varieties. it is also a remarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses though of course compounded of the very same two species the one species having first been used as the father and then as the mother generally differ in fertility in a small and occasionally in a high degree. several other singular rules could be given from grtner for instance some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring but these two powers do not at all necessarily go together. there are certain hybrids which instead of having as is usual an intermediate character between their two parents always closely resemble one of them and such hybrids though externally so like one of their pure parentspecies are with rare exceptions extremely sterile. so again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between their parents exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are born which closely resemble one of their pure parents and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of fertility. these facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent. considering the several rules now given which govern the fertility of first crosses and of hybrids we see that when forms which must be considered as good and distinct species are united their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility or even to fertility under certain conditions in excess. that their fertility besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions is innately variable. that it is by no means always the same in degree in the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross. that the fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external appearance either parent. and lastly that the facility of making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. this latter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species for according as the one species or the other is used as the father or the mother there is generally some difference and occasionally the widest possible difference in the facility of effecting an union. the hybrids moreover produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility. now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in nature? i think not. for why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree when various species are crossed all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together? why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species? why should some species cross with facility and yet produce very sterile hybrids and other species cross with extreme difficulty and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids? why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species? why it may even be asked has the production of hybrids been permitted? to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids and then to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility not strictly related to the facility of the first union between their parents seems to be a strange arrangement. the foregoing rules and facts on the other hand appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences chiefly in the reproductive systems of the species which are crossed. the differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature that in reciprocal crosses between two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other but not in a reversed direction. it will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an example what i mean by sterility being incidental on other differences and not a specially endowed quality. as the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state of nature i presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a specially endowed quality but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants. we can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth in the hardness of their wood in the period of the flow or nature of their sap etc. but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever. great diversity in the size of two plants one being woody and the other herbaceous one being evergreen and the other deciduous and adaptation to widely different climates does not always prevent the two grafting together. as in hybridisation so with grafting the capacity is limited by systematic affinity for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging to quite distinct families and on the other hand closely allied species and varieties of the same species can usually but not invariably be grafted with ease. but this capacity as in hybridisation is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity. although many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted together in other cases species of the same genus will not take on each other. the pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince which is ranked as a distinct genus than on the apple which is a member of the same genus. even different varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the quince so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum. as grtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different individuals of the same two species in crossing so sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being grafted together. as in reciprocal crosses the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal so it sometimes is in grafting the common gooseberry for instance cannot be grafted on the currant whereas the currant will take though with difficulty on the gooseberry. we have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive organs in an imperfect condition is a very different case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species which have their reproductive organs perfect yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent parallel. something analogous occurs in grafting for thouin found that three species of robinia which seeded freely on their own roots and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on another species when thus grafted were rendered barren. on the other hand certain species of sorbus when grafted on other species yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own roots. we are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of hippeastrum lobelia etc. which seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of distinct species than when selffertilised with their own pollen. we thus see that although there is a clear and fundamental difference between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and female elements in the act of reproduction yet that there is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species. and as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems so i believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are incidental on unknown differences chiefly in their reproductive systems. these differences in both cases follow to a certain extent as might have been expected systematic affinity by which every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. the facts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been a special endowment although in the case of crossing the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare. causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.we may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. these two cases are fundamentally different for as just remarked in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual elements are perfect whereas in hybrids they are imperfect. even in first crosses the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes. there must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollentubes to reach the ovarium. it has also been observed that when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species though the pollentubes protrude they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface. again the male element may reach the female element but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed as seems to have been the case with some of thurets experiments on fuci. no explanation can be given of these facts any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others. lastly an embryo may be developed and then perish at an early period. this latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to but i believe from observations communicated to me by mr. hewitt who has had great experience in hybridising gallinaceous birds that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. i was at first very unwilling to believe in this view as hybrids when once born are generally healthy and longlived as we see in the case of the common mule. hybrids however are differently circumstanced before and after birth when born and living in a country where their two parents can live they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life. but a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother and therefore before birth as long as it is nourished within its mothers womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother it may be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable and consequently be liable to perish at an early period more especially as all very young beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life. in regard to the sterility of hybrids in which the sexual elements are imperfectly developed the case is very different. i have more than once alluded to a large body of facts which i have collected showing that when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected. this in fact is the great bar to the domestication of animals. between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids there are many points of similarity. in both cases the sterility is independent of general health and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. in both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees in both the male element is the most liable to be affected but sometimes the female more than the male. in both the tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids. on the other hand one species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. no one can tell till he tries whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or any plant seed freely under culture nor can he tell till he tries whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids. lastly when organic beings are placed during several generations under conditions not natural to them they are extremely liable to vary which is due as i believe to their reproductive systems having been specially affected though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues. so it is with hybrids for hybrids in successive generations are eminently liable to vary as every experimentalist has observed. thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural conditions and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of two species the reproductive system independently of the general state of health is affected by sterility in a very similar manner. in the one case the conditions of life have been disturbed though often in so slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us in the other case or that of hybrids the external conditions have remained the same but the organisation has been disturbed by two different structures and constitutions having been blended into one. for it is scarcely possible that two organisations should be compounded into one without some disturbance occurring in the development or periodical action or mutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another or to the conditions of life. when hybrids are able to breed inter se they transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same compounded organisation and hence we need not be surprised that their sterility though in some degree variable rarely diminishes. it must however be confessed that we cannot understand excepting on vague hypotheses several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids for instance the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. nor do i pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter no explanation is offered why an organism when placed under unnatural conditions is rendered sterile. all that i have attempted to show is that in two cases in some respects allied sterility is the common resultin the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been compounded into one. it may seem fanciful but i suspect that a similar parallelism extends to an allied yet very different class of facts. it is an old and almost universal belief founded i think on a considerable body of evidence that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things. we see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent exchanges of seed tubers etc. from one soil or climate to another and back again. during the convalescence of animals we plainly see that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of life. again both with plants and animals there is abundant evidence that a cross between very distinct individuals of the same species that is between members of different strains or subbreeds gives vigour and fertility to the offspring. i believe indeed from the facts alluded to in our fourth hermaphrodites and that close interbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest relations especially if these be kept under the same conditions of life always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny. hence it seems that on the one hand slight changes in the conditions of life benefit all organic beings and on the other hand that slight crosses that is crosses between the males and females of the same species which have varied and become slightly different give vigour and fertility to the offspring. but we have seen that greater changes or changes of a particular nature often render organic beings in some degree sterile and that greater crosses that is crosses between males and females which have become widely or specifically different produce hybrids which are generally sterile in some degree. i cannot persuade myself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion. both series of facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond which is essentially related to the principle of life. fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring.it may be urged as a most forcible argument that there must be some essential distinction between species and varieties and that there must be some error in all the foregoing remarks inasmuch as varieties however much they may differ from each other in external appearance cross with perfect facility and yield perfectly fertile offspring. i fully admit that this is almost invariably the case. but if we look to varieties produced under nature we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together they are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. for instance the blue and red pimpernel the primrose and cowslip which are considered by many of our best botanists as varieties are said by grtner not to be quite fertile when crossed and he consequently ranks them as undoubted species. if we thus argue in a circle the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be granted. if we turn to varieties produced or supposed to have been produced under domestication we are still involved in doubt. for when it is stated for instance that the german spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with foxes or that certain south american indigenous domestic dogs do not readily cross with european dogs the explanation which will occur to everyone and probably the true one is that these dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species. nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties differing widely from each other in appearance for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage is a remarkable fact more especially when we reflect how many species there are which though resembling each other most closely are utterly sterile when intercrossed. several considerations however render the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears. it can in the first place be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties. in the second place some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids which were at first only slightly sterile and if this be so we surely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing under nearly the same conditions of life. lastly and this seems to me by far the most important consideration new races of animals and plants are produced under domestication by mans methodical and unconscious power of selection for his own use and pleasure he neither wishes to select nor could select slight differences in the reproductive system or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive system. he supplies his several varieties with the same food treats them in nearly the same manner and does not wish to alter their general habits of life. nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods of time on the whole organisation in any way which may be for each creatures own good and thus she may either directly or more probably indirectly through correlation modify the reproductive system in the several descendants from any one species. seeing this difference in the process of selection as carried on by man and nature we need not be surprised at some difference in the result. i have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were invariably fertile when intercrossed. but it seems to me impossible to resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few following cases which i will briefly abstract. the evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of species. the evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction. grtner kept during several years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds and a tall variety with red seeds growing near each other in his garden and although these plants have separated sexes they never naturally crossed. he then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other but only a single head produced any seed and this one head produced only five grains. manipulation in this case could not have been injurious as the plants have separated sexes. no one i believe has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves perfectly fertile so that even grtner did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct. girou de buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd which like the maize has separated sexes and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are greater. how far these experiments may be trusted i know not but the forms experimentised on are ranked by sagaret who mainly founds his classification by the test of infertility as varieties. the following case is far more remarkable and seems at first quite incredible but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments made during many years on nine species of verbascum by so good an observer and so hostile a witness as grtner namely that yellow and white varieties of the same species of verbascum when intercrossed produce less seed than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from their own coloured flowers. moreover he asserts that when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a distinct species more seed is produced by the crosses between the same coloured flowers than between those which are differently coloured. yet these varieties of verbascum present no other difference besides the mere colour of the flower and one variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of the other. from observations which i have made on certain varieties of hollyhock i am inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts. klreuter whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer has proved the remarkable fact that one variety of the common tobacco is more fertile when crossed with a widely distinct species than are the other varieties. he experimentised on five forms which are commonly reputed to be varieties and which he tested by the severest trial namely by reciprocal crosses and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly fertile. but one of these five varieties when used either as father or mother and crossed with the nicotiana glutinosa always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties when crossed with n. glutinosa. hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified. from these facts from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature for a supposed variety if infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species from man selecting only external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic varieties and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system from these several considerations and facts i do not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties and species. the general fertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view which i have taken with respect to the very general but not invariable sterility of first crosses and of hybrids namely that it is not a special endowment but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications more especially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed. hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility.independently of the question of fertility the offspring of species when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects. grtner whose strong wish was to draw a marked line of distinction between species and varieties could find very few and as it seems to me quite unimportant differences between the socalled hybrid offspring of species and the socalled mongrel offspring of varieties. and on the other hand they agree most closely in very many important respects. i shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. the most important distinction is that in the first generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids but grtner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation and i have myself seen striking instances of this fact. grtner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away. when mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring is notorious but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given. the variability however in the successive generations of mongrels is perhaps greater than in hybrids. this greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at all surprising. for the parents of mongrels are varieties and mostly domestic varieties very few experiments having been tried on natural varieties and this implies in most cases that there has been recent variability and therefore we might expect that such variability would often continue and be superadded to that arising from the mere act of crossing. the slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross or in the first generation in contrast with their extreme variability in the succeeding generations is a curious fact and deserves attention. for it bears on and corroborates the view which i have taken on the cause of ordinary variability namely that it is due to the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life being thus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identical with the parentform. now hybrids in the first generation are descended from species excluding those long cultivated which have not had their reproductive systems in any way affected and they are not variable but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected and their descendants are highly variable. but to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids grtner states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parentform but this if it be true is certainly only a difference in degree. grtner further insists that when any two species although most closely allied to each other are crossed with a third species the hybrids are widely different from each other whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species the hybrids do not differ much. but this conclusion as far as i can make out is founded on a single experiment and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by klreuter. these alone are the unimportant differences which grtner is able to point out between hybrid and mongrel plants. on the other hand the resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species follows according to grtner the same laws. when two species are crossed one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the hybrid and so i believe it to be with varieties of plants. with animals one variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another variety. hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross generally resemble each other closely and so it is with mongrels from a reciprocal cross. both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parentform by repeated crosses in successive generations with either parent. these several remarks are apparently applicable to animals but the subject is here excessively complicated partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual characters but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other both when one species is crossed with another and when one variety is crossed with another variety. for instance i think those authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the maleass than in the female so that the mule which is the offspring of the maleass and mare is more like an ass than is the hinny which is the offspring of the femaleass and stallion. much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact that mongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents but it can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids yet i grant much less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels. looking to the cases which i have collected of crossbred animals closely resembling one parent the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature and which have suddenly appearedsuch as albinism melanism deficiency of tail or horns or additional fingers and toes and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection. consequently sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semimonstrous in character than with hybrids which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced. on the whole i entirely agree with dr. prosper lucas who after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same whether the two parents differ much or little from each other namely in the union of individuals of the same variety or of different varieties or of distinct species. laying aside the question of fertility and sterility in all other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring of crossed species and of crossed varieties. if we look at species as having been specially created and at varieties as having been produced by secondary laws this similarity would be an astonishing fact. but it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction between species and varieties. to be ranked as species and their hybrids are very generally but not universally sterile. the sterility is of all degrees and is often so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. the sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species and is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions. the degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity but is governed by several curious and complex laws. it is generally different and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same two species. it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross. in the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one species or variety to take on another is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems so in crossing the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. there is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests. the sterility of first crosses between pure species which have their reproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several circumstances in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo. the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive systems imperfect and which have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed. this view is supported by a parallelism of another kindnamely that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings. it is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species and the degree of sterility of their hybridoffspring should generally correspond though due to distinct causes for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed. nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross the fertility of the hybrids produced and the capacity of being grafted togetherthough this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstancesshould all run to a certain extent parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species. first crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring are very generally but not quite universally fertile. nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences and not of differences in the reproductive system. in all other respects excluding fertility there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels. me opposed to but even rather to support the view that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.   on the imperfection of the geological record.  on the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day. on the nature of extinct intermediate varieties on their number. on the vast lapse of time as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation. on the poorness of our palontological collections. on the intermittence of geological formations. on the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation. on the sudden appearance of groups of species. on their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata.  justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. most of them have now been discussed. one namely the distinctness of specific forms and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links is a very obvious difficulty. i assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence namely on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical conditions. i endeavoured to show that the life of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other already defined organic forms than on climate and therefore that the really governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. i endeavoured also to show that intermediate varieties from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement. the main cause however of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends on the very process of natural selection through which new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their parentforms. but just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale so must the number of intermediate varieties which have formerly existed on the earth be truly enormous. why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain and this perhaps is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. the explanation lies as i believe in the extreme imperfection of the geological record. in the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of intermediate forms must on my theory have formerly existed. i have found it difficult when looking at any two species to avoid picturing to myself forms directly intermediate between them. but this is a wholly false view we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants. to give a simple illustration the fantail and pouter pigeons have both descended from the rockpigeon if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed we should have an extremely close series between both and the rockpigeon but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter none for instance combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged the characteristic features of these two breeds. these two breeds moreover have become so much modified that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rockpigeon whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species such as c. oenas. so with natural species if we look to forms very distinct for instance to the horse and tapir we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them but between each and an unknown common parent. the common parent will have had in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse but in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both even perhaps more than they differ from each other. hence in all such cases we should be unable to recognise the parentform of any two or more species even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants unless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links. it is just possible by my theory that one of two living forms might have descended from the other for instance a horse from a tapir and in this case direct intermediate links will have existed between them. but such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change and the principle of competition between organism and organism between child and parent will render this a very rare event for in all cases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms. by the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected with the parentspecies of each genus by differences not greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the present day and these parentspecies now generally extinct have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient species and so on backwards always converging to the common ancestor of each great class. so that the number of intermediate and transitional links between all living and extinct species must have been inconceivably great. but assuredly if this theory be true such have lived upon this earth. on the lapse of time.independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely numerous connecting links it may be objected that time will not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change all changes having been effected very slowly through natural selection. it is hardly possible for me even to recall to the reader who may not be a practical geologist the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time. he who can read sir charles lyells grand work on the principles of geology which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time may at once close this volume. not that it suffices to study the principles of geology or to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation or even each stratum. a man must for years examine for himself great piles of superimposed strata and watch the sea at work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment before he can hope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time the monuments of which we see around us. it is good to wander along lines of seacoast when formed of moderately hard rocks and mark the process of degradation. the tides in most cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day and the waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles for there is reason to believe that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away rock. at last the base of the cliff is undermined huge fragments fall down and these remaining fixed have to be worn away atom by atom until reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves and then are more quickly ground into pebbles sand or mud. but how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders all thickly clothed by marine productions showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! moreover if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff which is undergoing degradation we find that it is only here and there along a short length or round a promontory that the cliffs are at the present time suffering. the appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base. he who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores will i believe be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts are worn away. the observations on this head by hugh miller and by that excellent observer mr. smith of jordan hill are most impressive. with the mind thus impressed let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand feet in thickness which though probably formed at a quicker rate than many other deposits yet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles each of which bears the stamp of time are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated. let him remember lyells profound remark that the thickness and extent of sedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which the earths crust has elsewhere suffered. and what an amount of degradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries! professor ramsay has given me the maximum thickness in most cases from actual measurement in a few cases from estimate of each formation in different parts of great britain and this is the result feet palozoic strata not including igneous beds...57154. secondary strata................................13190. tertiary strata..................................2240. making altogether 72584 feet that is very nearly thirteen and threequarters british miles. some of these formations which are represented in england by thin beds are thousands of feet in thickness on the continent. moreover between each successive formation we have in the opinion of most geologists enormously long blank periods. so that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation yet what time this must have consumed! good observers have estimated that sediment is deposited by the great mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a hundred thousand years. this estimate may be quite erroneous yet considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is transported by the currents of the sea the process of accumulation in any one area must be extremely slow. but the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time. i remember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation when viewing volcanic islands which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height for the gentle slope of the lavastreams due to their formerly liquid state showed at a glance how far the hard rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. the same story is still more plainly told by faultsthose great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side or thrown down on the other to the height or depth of thousands of feet for since the crust cracked the surface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible. the craven fault for instance extends for upwards of 30 miles and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to 3000 feet. professor ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in anglesea of 2300 feet and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in merionethshire of 12000 feet yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept away. the consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity. i am tempted to give one other case the wellknown one of the denudation of the weald. though it must be admitted that the denudation of the weald has been a mere trifle in comparison with that which has removed masses of our palozoic strata in parts ten thousand feet in thickness as shown in professor ramsays masterly memoir on this subject. yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the north downs and to look at the distant south downs for remembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and close one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which must have covered up the weald within so limited a period as since the latter part of the chalk formation. the distance from the northern to the southern downs is about 22 miles and the thickness of the several formations is on an average about 1100 feet as i am informed by professor ramsay. but if as some geologists suppose a range of older rocks underlies the weald on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere the above estimate would be erroneous but this source of doubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the district. if then we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height we could measure the time requisite to have denuded the weald. this of course cannot be done but we may in order to form some crude notion on the subject assume that the sea would eat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century. this will at first appear much too small an allowance but it is the same as if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twentytwo years. i doubt whether any rock even as soft as chalk would yield at this rate excepting on the most exposed coasts though no doubt the degradation of a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen fragments. on the other hand i do not believe that any line of coast ten or twenty miles in length ever suffers degradation at the same time along its whole indented length and we must remember that almost all strata contain harder layers or nodules which from long resisting attrition form a breakwater at the base. hence under ordinary circumstances i conclude that for a cliff 500 feet in height a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be an ample allowance. at this rate on the above data the denudation of the weald must have required 306662400 years or say three hundred million years. the action of fresh water on the gently inclined wealden district when upraised could hardly have been great but it would somewhat reduce the above estimate. on the other hand during oscillations of level which we know this area has undergone the surface may have existed for millions of years as land and thus have escaped the action of the sea when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods it would likewise have escaped the action of the coastwaves. so that in all probability a far longer period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of the secondary period. i have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain some notion however imperfect of the lapse of years. during each of these years over the whole world the land and the water has been peopled by hosts of living forms. what an infinite number of generations which the mind cannot grasp must have succeeded each other in the long roll of years! now turn to our richest geological museums and what a paltry display we behold! on the poorness of our palontological collections.that our palontological collections are very imperfect is admitted by every one. the remark of that admirable palontologist the late edward forbes should not be forgotten namely that numbers of our fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored and no part with sufficient care as the important discoveries made every year in europe prove. no organism wholly soft can be preserved. shells and bones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea where sediment is not accumulating. i believe we are continually taking a most erroneous view when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. the many cases on record of a formation conformably covered after an enormous interval of time by another and later formation without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. the remains which do become embedded if in sand or gravel will when the beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation of rainwater. i suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved. for instance the several species of the chthamalin a subfamily of sessile cirripedes coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers they are all strictly littoral with the exception of a single mediterranean species which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in sicily whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation yet it is now known that the genus chthamalus existed during the chalk period. the molluscan genus chiton offers a partially analogous case. with respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the secondary and palozoic periods it is superfluous to state that our evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree. for instance not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast periods with one exception discovered by sir c. lyell in the carboniferous strata of north america. in regard to mammiferous remains a single glance at the historical table published in the supplement to lyells manual will bring home the truth how accidental and rare is their preservation far better than pages of detail. nor is their rarity surprising when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palozoic formations. but the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing namely from the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals of time. when we see the formations tabulated in written works or when we follow them in nature it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive. but we know for instance from sir r. murchisons great work on russia what wide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed formations so it is in north america and in many other parts of the world. the most skilful geologist if his attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country great piles of sediment charged with new and peculiar forms of life had elsewhere been accumulated. and if in each separate territory hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive formations we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained. the frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations generally implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands whence the sediment has been derived accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between each formation. but we can i think see why the geological formations of each region are almost invariably intermittent that is have not followed each other in close sequence. scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many hundred miles of the south american coasts which have been upraised several hundred feet within the recent period than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological period. along the whole west coast which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna tertiary beds are so scantily developed that no record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a distant age. a little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of the western side of south america no extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great from the enormous degradation of the coastrocks and from muddy streams entering the sea. the explanation no doubt is that the littoral and sublittoral deposits are continually worn away as soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of the coastwaves. we may i think safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick solid or extensive masses in order to withstand the incessant action of the waves when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level. such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways either in profound depths of the sea in which case judging from the researches of e. forbes we may conclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals and the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then existed or sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom if it continue slowly to subside. in this latter case as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each other the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life and thus a fossiliferous formation thick enough when upraised to resist any amount of degradation may be formed. i am convinced that all our ancient formations which are rich in fossils have thus been formed during subsidence. since publishing my views on this subject in 1845 i have watched the progress of geology and have been surprised to note how author after author in treating of this or that great formation has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence. i may add that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of south america which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered but which will hardly last to a distant geological age was certainly deposited during a downward oscillation of level and thus gained considerable thickness. all geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous slow oscillations of level and apparently these oscillations have affected wide spaces. consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation may have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence but only where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. on the other hand as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary thick deposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts which are the most favourable to life. still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of elevation or to speak more accurately the beds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the coastaction. thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered intermittent. i feel much confidence in the truth of these views for they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by sir c. lyell and e. forbes independently arrived at a similar conclusion. one remark is here worth a passing notice. during periods of elevation the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be increased and new stations will often be formedall circumstances most favourable as previously explained for the formation of new varieties and species but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the geological record. on the other hand during subsidence the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease excepting the productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago and consequently during subsidence though there will be much extinction fewer new varieties or species will be formed and it is during these very periods of subsidence that our great deposits rich in fossils have been accumulated. nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking forms. from the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological record viewed as a whole is extremely imperfect but if we confine our attention to any one formation it becomes more difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close. some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation but as they are rare they may be here passed over. although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition i can see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series of links between the species which then lived but i can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following considerations. although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years each perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another. i am aware that two palontologists whose opinions are worthy of much deference namely bronn and woodward have concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of specific forms. but insuperable difficulties as it seems to me prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head. when we see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation it would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed. so again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited it would be equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct. we forget how small the area of europe is compared with the rest of the world nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout europe been correlated with perfect accuracy. with marine animals of all kinds we may safely infer a large amount of migration during climatal and other changes and when we see a species first appearing in any formation the probability is that it only then first immigrated into that area. it is well known for instance that several species appeared somewhat earlier in the palozoic beds of north america than in those of europe time having apparently been required for their migration from the american to the european seas. in examining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world it has everywhere been noted that some few still existing species are common in the deposit but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea or conversely that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea but are rare or absent in this particular deposit. it is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of europe during the glacial period which forms only a part of one whole geological period and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level on the inordinately great change of climate on the prodigious lapse of time all included within this same glacial period. yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world sedimentary deposits including fossil remains have gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. it is not for instance probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the mississippi within that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish for we know what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of america during this space of time. when such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of the mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been upraised organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at different levels owing to the migration of species and to geographical changes. and in the distant future a geologist examining these beds might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period instead of having been really far greater that is extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day. in order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation the deposit must have gone on accumulating for a very long period in order to have given sufficient time for the slow process of variation hence the deposit will generally have to be a very thick one and the species undergoing modification will have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time. but we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of subsidence and to keep the depth approximately the same which is necessary in order to enable the same species to live on the same space the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount of subsidence. but this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment is derived and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement continues. in fact this nearly exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency for it has been observed by more than one palontologist that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains except near their upper or lower limits. it would seem that each separate formation like the whole pile of formations in any country has generally been intermittent in its accumulation. when we see as is so often the case a formation composed of beds of different mineralogical composition we may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted as a change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will generally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time. nor will the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which its deposition has consumed. many instances could be given of beds only a few feet in thickness representing formations elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness and which must have required an enormous period for their accumulation yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. many cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised denuded submerged and then recovered by the upper beds of the same formationfacts showing what wide yet easily overlooked intervals have occurred in its accumulation. in other cases we have the plainest evidence in great fossilised trees still standing upright as they grew of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition which would never even have been suspected had not the trees chanced to have been preserved thus messrs. lyell and dawson found carboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in nova scotia with ancient rootbearing strata one above the other at no less than sixtyeight different levels. hence when the same species occur at the bottom middle and top of a formation the probability is that they have not lived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition but have disappeared and reappeared perhaps many times during the same geological period. so that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification during any one geological period a section would not probably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed between them but abrupt though perhaps very slight changes of form. it is allimportant to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties they grant some little variability to each species but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms they rank both as species unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate gradations. and this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. supposing b and c to be two species and a third a to be found in an underlying bed even if a were strictly intermediate between b and c it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species unless at the same time it could be most closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties. nor should it be forgotten as before explained that a might be the actual progenitor of b and c and yet might not at all necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of structure. so that we might obtain the parentspecies and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations we should not recognise their relationship and should consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species. it is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palontologists have founded their species and they do this the more readily if the specimens come from different substages of the same formation. some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of dorbigny and others into the rank of varieties and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find. moreover if we look to rather wider intervals namely to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation we find that the embedded fossils though almost universally ranked as specifically different yet are far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in more widely separated formations but to this subject i shall one other consideration is worth notice with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive there is reason to suspect as we have formerly seen that their varieties are generally at first local and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parentforms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree. according to this view the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms is small for the successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot. most marine animals have a wide range and we have seen that with plants it is those which have the widest range that oftenest present varieties so that with shells and other marine animals it is probably those which have had the widest range far exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of europe which have oftenest given rise first to local varieties and ultimately to new species and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation. it should not be forgotten that at the present day with perfect specimens for examination two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species until many specimens have been collected from many places and in the case of fossil species this could rarely be effected by palontologists. we shall perhaps best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous fine intermediate fossil links by asking ourselves whether for instance geologists at some future period will be able to prove that our different breeds of cattle sheep horses and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks or again whether certain seashells inhabiting the shores of north america which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their european representatives and by other conchologists as only varieties are really varieties or are as it is called specifically distinct. this could be effected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations and such success seems to me improbable in the highest degree. geological research though it has added numerous species to existing and extinct genera and has made the intervals between some few groups less wide than they otherwise would have been yet has done scarcely anything in breaking down the distinction between species by connecting them together by numerous fine intermediate varieties and this not having been effected is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the many objections which may be urged against my views. hence it will be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks under an imaginary illustration. the malay archipelago is of about the size of europe from the north cape to the mediterranean and from britain to russia and therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined with any accuracy excepting those of the united states of america. i fully agree with mr. godwinausten that the present condition of the malay archipelago with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas probably represents the former state of europe when most of our formations were accumulating. the malay archipelago is one of the richest regions of the whole world in organic beings yet if all the species were to be collected which have ever lived there how imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world! but we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. i suspect that not many of the strictly littoral animals or of those which lived on naked submarine rocks would be embedded and those embedded in gravel or sand would not endure to a distant epoch. wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay no remains could be preserved. in our archipelago i believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed of sufficient thickness to last to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie in the past only during periods of subsidence. these periods of subsidence would be separated from each other by enormous intervals during which the area would be either stationary or rising whilst rising each fossiliferous formation would be destroyed almost as soon as accumulated by the incessant coastaction as we now see on the shores of south america. during the periods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life during the periods of elevation there would be much variation but the geological record would then be least perfect. it may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago together with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment would exceed the average duration of the same specific forms and these contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations between any two or more species. if such gradations were not fully preserved transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species. it is also probable that each great period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level and that slight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one formation. very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these farranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place but if possessed of any decided advantage or when further modified and improved they would slowly spread and supplant their parentforms. when such varieties returned to their ancient homes as they would differ from their former state in a nearly uniform though perhaps extremely slight degree they would according to the principles followed by many palontologists be ranked as new and distinct species. if then there be some degree of truth in these remarks we have no right to expect to find in our geological formations an infinite number of those fine transitional forms which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life. we ought only to look for a few links some more closely some more distantly related to each other and these links let them be ever so close if found in different stages of the same formation would by most palontologists be ranked as distinct species. but i do not pretend that i should ever have suspected how poor a record of the mutations of life the best preserved geological section presented had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each formation pressed so hardly on my theory. on the sudden appearance of whole groups of allied species.the abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations has been urged by several palontologists for instance by agassiz pictet and by none more forcibly than by professor sedgwick as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. if numerous species belonging to the same genera or families have really started into life all at once the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection. for the development of a group of forms all of which have descended from some one progenitor must have been an extremely slow process and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their modified descendants. but we continually overrate the perfection of the geological record and falsely infer because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain stage that they did not exist before that stage. we continually forget how large the world is compared with the area over which our geological formations have been carefully examined we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of europe and of the united states. we do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have probably elapsed between our consecutive formationslonger perhaps in some cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation. these intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from some one or some few parentforms and in the succeeding formation such species will appear as if suddenly created. i may here recall a remark formerly made namely that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life for instance to fly through the air but that when this had been effected and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms which would be able to spread rapidly and widely throughout the world. i will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced. i may recall the wellknown fact that in geological treatises published not many years ago the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series. and now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series. cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum but now extinct species have been discovered in india south america and in europe even as far back as the eocene stage. the most striking case however is that of the whale family as these animals have huge bones are marine and range over the world the fact of not a single bone of a whale having been discovered in any secondary formation seemed fully to justify the belief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly produced in the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiary formation. but now we may read in the supplement to lyells manual published in 1858 clear evidence of the existence of whales in the upper greensand some time before the close of the secondary period. i may give another instance which from having passed under my own eyes has much struck me. in a memoir on fossil sessile cirripedes i have stated that from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the world from the arctic regions to the equator inhabiting various zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised from all these circumstances i inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods they would certainly have been preserved and discovered and as not one species had been discovered in beds of this age i concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series. this was a sore trouble to me adding as i thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. but my work had hardly been published when a skilful palontologist m. bosquet sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede which he had himself extracted from the chalk of belgium. and as if to make the case as striking as possible this sessile cirripede was a chthamalus a very common large and ubiquitous genus of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary period and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many tertiary and existing species. the case most frequently insisted on by palontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species is that of the teleostean fishes low down in the chalk period. this group includes the large majority of existing species. lately professor pictet has carried their existence one substage further back and some palontologists believe that certain much older fishes of which the affinities are as yet imperfectly known are really teleostean. assuming however that the whole of them did appear as agassiz believes at the commencement of the chalk formation the fact would certainly be highly remarkable but i cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same period. it is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossilfish are known from south of the equator and by running through pictets palontology it will be seen that very few species are known from several formations in europe. some few families of fish now have a confined range the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly confined range and after having been largely developed in some one sea might have spread widely. nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at present. even at this day if the malay archipelago were converted into land the tropical parts of the indian ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin in which any great group of marine animals might be multiplied and here they would remain confined until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate and were enabled to double the southern capes of africa or australia and thus reach other and distant seas. from these and similar considerations but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of europe and the united states and from the revolution in our palontological ideas on many points which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in australia and then to discuss the number and range of its productions. on the sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the lowest known fossiliferous strata.there is another and allied difficulty which is much graver. i allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. most of the arguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group have descended from one progenitor apply with nearly equal force to the earliest known species. for instance i cannot doubt that all the silurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean which must have lived long before the silurian age and which probably differed greatly from any known animal. some of the most ancient silurian animals as the nautilus lingula etc. do not differ much from living species and it cannot on my theory be supposed that these old species were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate between them. if moreover they had been the progenitors of these orders they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous and improved descendants. consequently if my theory be true it is indisputable that before the lowest silurian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed as long as or probably far longer than the whole interval from the silurian age to the present day and that during these vast yet quite unknown periods of time the world swarmed with living creatures. to the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods i can give no satisfactory answer. several of the most eminent geologists with sir r. murchison at their head are convinced that we see in the organic remains of the lowest silurian stratum the dawn of life on this planet. other highly competent judges as lyell and the late e. forbes dispute this conclusion. we should not forget that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy. m. barrande has lately added another and lower stage to the silurian system abounding with new and peculiar species. traces of life have been detected in the longmynd beds beneath barrandes socalled primordial zone. the presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods. but the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the silurian epoch is very great. if these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation or obliterated by metamorphic action we ought to find only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age and these ought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition. but the descriptions which we now possess of the silurian deposits over immense territories in russia and in north america do not support the view that the older a formation is the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation and metamorphism. the case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. to show that it may hereafter receive some explanation i will give the following hypothesis. from the nature of the organic remains which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths in the several formations of europe and of the united states and from the amount of sediment miles in thickness of which the formations are composed we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land whence the sediment was derived occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of europe and north america. but we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals between the successive formations whether europe and the united states during these intervals existed as dry land or as a submarine surface near land on which sediment was not deposited or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea. looking to the existing oceans which are thrice as extensive as the land we see them studded with many islands but not one oceanic island is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palozoic or secondary formation. hence we may perhaps infer that during the palozoic and secondary periods neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend for had they existed there palozoic and secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level which we may fairly conclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods. if then we may infer anything from these facts we may infer that where our oceans now extend oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record and on the other hand that where continents now exist large tracts of land have existed subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level since the earliest silurian period. the coloured map appended to my volume on coral reefs led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence the great archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level and the continents areas of elevation. but have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from eternity? our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance during many oscillations of level of the force of elevation but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages? at a period immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now stand. nor should we be justified in assuming that if for instance the bed of the pacific ocean were now converted into a continent we should there find formations older than the silurian strata supposing such to have been formerly deposited for it might well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water might have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always remained nearer to the surface. the immense areas in some parts of the world for instance in south america of bare metamorphic rocks which must have been heated under great pressure have always seemed to me to require some special explanation and we may perhaps believe that we see in these large areas the many formations long anterior to the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition. the several difficulties here discussed namely our not finding in the successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the many species which now exist or have existed the sudden manner in which whole groups of species appear in our european formations the almost entire absence as at present known of fossiliferous formations beneath the silurian strata are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature. we see this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent palontologists namely cuvier owen agassiz barrande falconer e. forbes etc. and all our greatest geologists as lyell murchison sedgwick etc. have unanimously often vehemently maintained the immutability of species. but i have reason to believe that one great authority sir charles lyell from further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject. i feel how rash it is to differ from these great authorities to whom with others we owe all our knowledge. those who think the natural geological record in any degree perfect and who do not attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given in this volume will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. for my part following out lyells metaphor i look at the natural geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect of this history we possess the last volume alone relating only to two or three countries. of this been preserved and of each page only here and there a few lines. each word of the slowlychanging language in which the history is supposed to be written being more or less different in the interrupted forms of life entombed in our consecutive but widely separated formations. on this view the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished or even disappear.   on the geological succession of organic beings.  on the slow and successive appearance of new species. on their different rates of change. species once lost do not reappear. groups of species follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species. on extinction. on simultaneous changes in the forms of life throughout the world. on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living species. on the state of development of ancient forms. on the succession of the same types  let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the geological succession of organic beings better accord with the common view of the immutability of species or with that of their slow and gradual modification through descent and natural selection. new species have appeared very slowly one after another both on the land and in the waters. lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them and to make the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual. in some of the most recent beds though undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years only one or two species are lost forms and only one or two are new forms having here appeared for the first time either locally or as far as we know on the face of the earth. if we may trust the observations of philippi in sicily the successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual. the secondary formations are more broken but as bronn has remarked neither the appearance nor disappearance of their many now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation. species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate or in the same degree. in the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms. falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact in an existing crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the subhimalayan deposits. the silurian lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus whereas most of the other silurian molluscs and all the crustaceans have changed greatly. the productions of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea of which a striking instance has lately been observed in switzerland. there is some reason to believe that organisms considered high in the scale of nature change more quickly than those that are low though there are exceptions to this rule. the amount of organic change as pictet has remarked does not strictly correspond with the succession of our geological formations so that between each two consecutive formations the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree. yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations all the species will be found to have undergone some change. when a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth we have reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears. the strongest apparent exception to this latter rule is that of the socalled colonies of m. barrande which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation and then allow the preexisting fauna to reappear but lyells explanation namely that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province seems to me satisfactory.  these several facts accord well with my theory. i believe in no fixed law of development causing all the inhabitants of a country to change abruptly or simultaneously or to an equal degree. the process of modification must be extremely slow. the variability of each species is quite independent of that of all others. whether such variability be taken advantage of by natural selection and whether the variations be accumulated to a greater or lesser amount thus causing a greater or lesser amount of modification in the varying species depends on many complex contingencieson the variability being of a beneficial nature on the power of intercrossing on the rate of breeding on the slowly changing physical conditions of the country and more especially on the nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into competition. hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much longer than others or if changing that it should change less. we see the same fact in geographical distribution for instance in the landshells and coleopterous insects of madeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of europe whereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered. we can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower productions by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and many of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved we can understand on the principle of competition and on that of the many allimportant relations of organism to organism that any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved will be liable to be exterminated. hence we can see why all the species in the same region do at last if we look to wide enough intervals of time become modified for those which do not change will become extinct. in members of the same class the average amount of change during long and equal periods of time may perhaps be nearly the same but as the accumulation of longenduring fossiliferous formations depends on great masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent intervals consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal. each formation on this view does not mark a new and complete act of creation but only an occasional scene taken almost at hazard in a slowly changing drama. we can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never reappear even if the very same conditions of life organic and inorganic should recur. for though the offspring of one species might be adapted and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature and thus supplant it yet the two formsthe old and the newwould not be identically the same for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors. for instance it is just possible if our fantailpigeons were all destroyed that fanciers by striving during long ages for the same object might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail but if the parent rockpigeon were also destroyed and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parentform will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring it is quite incredible that a fantail identical with the existing breed could be raised from any other species of pigeon or even from the other wellestablished races of the domestic pigeon for the newlyformed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences. groups of species that is genera and families follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species changing more or less quickly and in a greater or lesser degree. a group does not reappear after it has once disappeared or its existence as long as it lasts is continuous. i am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule but the exceptions are surprisingly few so few that e. forbes pictet and woodward though all strongly opposed to such views as i maintain admit its truth and the rule strictly accords with my theory. for as all the species of the same group have descended from some one species it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages so long must its members have continuously existed in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms. species of the genus lingula for instance must have continuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations from the lowest silurian stratum to the present day. falsely appear to have come in abruptly and i have attempted to give an explanation of this fact which if true would have been fatal to my views. but such cases are certainly exceptional the general rule being a gradual increase in number till the group reaches its maximum and then sooner or later it gradually decreases. if the number of the species of a genus or the number of the genera of a family be represented by a vertical line of varying thickness crossing the successive geological formations in which the species are found the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end not in a sharp point but abruptly it then gradually thickens upwards sometimes keeping for a space of equal thickness and ultimately thins out in the upper beds marking the decrease and final extinction of the species. this gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable with my theory as the species of the same genus and the genera of the same family can increase only slowly and progressively for the process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradualone species giving rise first to two or three varieties these being slowly converted into species which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other species and so on like the branching of a great tree from a single stem till the group becomes large. on extinction.we have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of species. on the theory of natural selection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately connected together. the old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes is very generally given up even by those geologists as elie de beaumont murchison barrande etc. whose general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion. on the contrary we have every reason to believe from the study of the tertiary formations that species and groups of species gradually disappear one after another first from one spot then from another and finally from the world. both single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods some groups as we have seen having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the present day some having disappeared before the close of the palozoic period. no fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any single species or any single genus endures. there is reason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process than their production if the appearance and disappearance of a group of species be represented as before by a vertical line of varying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end which marks the progress of extermination than at its lower end which marks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species. in some cases however the extermination of whole groups of beings as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period has been wonderfully sudden. the whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery. some authors have even supposed that as the individual has a definite length of life so have species a definite duration. no one i think can have marvelled more at the extinction of species than i have done. when i found in la plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of mastodon megatherium toxodon and other extinct monsters which all coexisted with still living shells at a very late geological period i was filled with astonishment for seeing that the horse since its introduction by the spaniards into south america has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate i asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable. but how utterly groundless was my astonishment! professor owen soon perceived that the tooth though so like that of the existing horse belonged to an extinct species. had this horse been still living but in some degree rare no naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes in all countries. if we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare we answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life but what that something is we can hardly ever tell. on the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals even of the slowbreeding elephant and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in south america that under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole continent. but we could not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase whether some one or several contingencies and at what period of the horses life and in what degree they severally acted. if the conditions had gone on however slowly becoming less and less favourable we assuredly should not have perceived the fact yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer and finally extinctits place being seized on by some more successful competitor. it is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity and finally extinction. we see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity precedes extinction and we know that this has been the progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated either locally or wholly through mans agency. i may repeat what i published in 1845 namely that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinctto feel no surprise at the rarity of a species and yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of deathto feel no surprise at sickness but when the sick man dies to wonder and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence. the theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new variety and ultimately each new species is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition and the consequent extinction of lessfavoured forms almost inevitably follows. it is the same with our domestic productions when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood when much improved it is transported far and near like our shorthorn cattle and takes the place of other breeds in other countries. thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms both natural and artificial are bound together. in certain flourishing groups the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated but we know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing at least during the later geological periods so that looking to later times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms. the competition will generally be most severe as formerly explained and illustrated by examples between the forms which are most like each other in all respects. hence the improved and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parentspecies and if many new forms have been developed from any one species the nearest allies of that species i.e. the species of the same genus will be the most liable to extermination. thus as i believe a number of new species descended from one species that is a new genus comes to supplant an old genus belonging to the same family. but it must often have happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group and thus caused its extermination and if many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder many will have to yield their places and it will generally be allied forms which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common. but whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class which yield their places to other species which have been modified and improved a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved from being fitted to some peculiar line of life or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station where they have escaped severe competition. for instance a single species of trigonia a great genus of shells in the secondary formations survives in the australian seas and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters. therefore the utter extinction of a group is generally as we have seen a slower process than its production. with respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders as of trilobites at the close of the palozoic period and of ammonites at the close of the secondary period we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our consecutive formations and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination. moreover when by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development many species of a new group have taken possession of a new area they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old inhabitants and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied for they will partake of some inferiority in common. thus as it seems to me the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural selection. we need not marvel at extinction if we must marvel let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many complex contingencies on which the existence of each species depends. if we forget for an instant that each species tends to increase inordinately and that some check is always in action yet seldom perceived by us the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured. whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant in individuals than that why this species and not another can be naturalised in a given country then and not till then we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this particular species or group of species. on the forms of life changing almost simultaneously throughout the world.scarcely any palontological discovery is more striking than the fact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world. thus our european chalk formation can be recognised in many distant parts of the world under the most different climates where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found namely in north america in equatorial south america in tierra del fuego at the cape of good hope and in the peninsula of india. for at these distant points the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to those of the chalk. it is not that the same species are met with for in some cases not one species is identically the same but they belong to the same families genera and sections of genera and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture. moreover other forms which are not found in the chalk of europe but which occur in the formations either above or below are similarly absent at these distant points of the world. in the several successive palozoic formations of russia western europe and north america a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors so it is according to lyell with the several european and north american tertiary deposits. even if the few fossil species which are common to the old and new worlds be kept wholly out of view the general parallelism in the successive forms of life in the stages of the widely separated palozoic and tertiary periods would still be manifest and the several formations could be easily correlated. these observations however relate to the marine inhabitants of distant parts of the world we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the same parallel manner. we may doubt whether they have thus changed if the megatherium mylodon macrauchenia and toxodon had been brought to europe from la plata without any information in regard to their geological position no one would have suspected that they had coexisted with still living seashells but as these anomalous monsters coexisted with the mastodon and horse it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages. when the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world it must not be supposed that this expression relates to the same thousandth or hundredthousandth year or even that it has a very strict geological sense for if all the marine animals which live at the present day in europe and all those that lived in europe during the pleistocene period an enormously remote period as measured by years including the whole glacial epoch were to be compared with those now living in south america or in australia the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the pleistocene inhabitants of europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere. so again several highly competent observers believe that the existing productions of the united states are more closely related to those which lived in europe during certain later tertiary stages than to those which now live here and if this be so it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of north america would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older european beds. nevertheless looking to a remotely future epoch there can i think be little doubt that all the more modern marine formations namely the upper pliocene the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of europe north and south america and australia from containing fossil remains in some degree allied and from not including those forms which are only found in the older underlying deposits would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological sense. the fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above large sense at distant parts of the world has greatly struck those admirable observers mm. de verneuil and darchiac. after referring to the parallelism of the palozoic forms of life in various parts of europe they add if struck by this strange sequence we turn our attention to north america and there discover a series of analogous phenomena it will appear certain that all these modifications of species their extinction and the introduction of new ones cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and temporary but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal kingdom. m. barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect. it is indeed quite futile to look to changes of currents climate or other physical conditions as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world under the most different climates. we must as barrande has remarked look to some special law. we shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present distribution of organic beings and find how slight is the relation between the physical conditions of various countries and the nature of their inhabitants. this great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout the world is explicable on the theory of natural selection. new species are formed by new varieties arising which have some advantage over older forms and those forms which are already dominant or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country would naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species for these latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to survive. we have distinct evidence on this head in the plants which are dominant that is which are commonest in their own homes and are most widely diffused having produced the greatest number of new varieties. it is also natural that the dominant varying and farspreading species which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further and of giving rise in new countries to new varieties and species. the process of diffusion may often be very slow being dependent on climatal and geographical changes or on strange accidents but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in spreading. the diffusion would it is probable be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. we might therefore expect to find as we apparently do find a less strict degree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the sea. dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more dominant species and then their triumphant course or even their existence would cease. we know not at all precisely what are all the conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant species but we can i think clearly see that a number of individuals from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations and that severe competition with many already existing forms would be highly favourable as would be the power of spreading into new territories. a certain amount of isolation recurring at long intervals of time would probably be also favourable as before explained. one quarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant species on the land and another for those in the waters of the sea. if two great regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an equal degree whenever their inhabitants met the battle would be prolonged and severe and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be victorious. but in the course of time the forms dominant in the highest degree wherever produced would tend everywhere to prevail. as they prevailed they would cause the extinction of other and inferior forms and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance whole groups would tend slowly to disappear though here and there a single member might long be enabled to survive. thus as it seems to me the parallel and taken in a large sense simultaneous succession of the same forms of life throughout the world accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying the new species thus produced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance and to having already had some advantage over their parents or over other species these again spreading varying and producing new species. the forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms will generally be allied in groups from inheriting some inferiority in common and therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world old groups will disappear from the world and the succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond. there is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. i have given my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous formations were deposited during periods of subsidence and that blank intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. during these long and blank intervals i suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction and that there was much migration from other parts of the world. as we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world but we are far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements. when two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly but not exactly the same period we should find in both from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs the same general succession in the forms of life but the species would not exactly correspond for there will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other for modification extinction and immigration. i suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in europe. mr. prestwich in his admirable memoirs on the eocene deposits of england and france is able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two countries but when he compares certain stages in england with those in france although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering the proximity of the two areasunless indeed it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct but contemporaneous faunas. lyell has made similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations. barrande also shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive silurian deposits of bohemia and scandinavia nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the species. if the several formations in these regions have not been deposited during the same exact periodsa formation in one region often corresponding with a blank interval in the otherand if in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals of time between them in this case the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order in accordance with the general succession of the form of life and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions. on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living forms.let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species. they all fall into one grand natural system and this fact is at once explained on the principle of descent. the more ancient any form is the more as a general rule it differs from living forms. but as buckland long ago remarked all fossils can be classed either in still existing groups or between them. that the extinct forms of life help to fill up the wide intervals between existing genera families and orders cannot be disputed. for if we confine our attention either to the living or to the extinct alone the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one general system. with respect to the vertebrata whole pages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great palontologist owen showing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups. cuvier ranked the ruminants and pachyderms as the two most distinct orders of mammals but owen has discovered so many fossil links that he has had to alter the whole classification of these two orders and has placed certain pachyderms in the same suborder with ruminants for example he dissolves by fine gradations the apparently wide difference between the pig and the camel. in regard to the invertebrata barrande and a higher authority could not be named asserts that he is every day taught that palozoic animals though belonging to the same orders families or genera with those living at the present day were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are. some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being considered as intermediate between living species or groups. if by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms the objection is probably valid. but i apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species would have to stand between living species and some extinct genera between living genera even between genera belonging to distinct families. the most common case especially with respect to very distinct groups such as fish and reptiles seems to be that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a dozen characters the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters so that the two groups though formerly quite distinct at that period made some small approach to each other. it is a common belief that the more ancient a form is by so much the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated from each other. this remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of geological ages and it would be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition for every now and then even a living animal as the lepidosiren is discovered having affinities directed towards very distinct groups. yet if we compare the older reptiles and batrachians the older fish the older cephalopods and the eocene mammals with the more recent members of the same classes we must admit that there is some truth in the remark. let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the theory of descent with modification. as the subject is somewhat complex i must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus. the diagram is much too simple too few genera and too few species being given but this is unimportant for us. the horizontal lines may represent successive geological formations and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct. the three existing genera a14 q14 p14 will form a small family b14 and f14 a closely allied family or subfamily and o14 e14 m14 a third family. these three families together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the parentform a will form an order for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient and common progenitor. on the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of character which was formerly illustrated by this diagram the more recent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor. hence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms. we must not however assume that divergence of character is a necessary contingency it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature. therefore it is quite possible as we have seen in the case of some silurian forms that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of life and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics. this is represented in the diagram by the letter f14. all the many forms extinct and recent descended from a make as before remarked one order and this order from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of character has become divided into several subfamilies and families some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods and some to have endured to the present day. by looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms supposed to be embedded in the successive formations were discovered at several points low down in the series the three existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. if for instance the genera a1 a5 a10 f8 m3 m6 m9 were disinterred these three families would be so closely linked together that they probably would have to be united into one great family in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms. yet he who objected to call the extinct genera which thus linked the living genera of three families together intermediate in character would be justified as they are intermediate not directly but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms. if many extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological formationsfor instance above number vi.but none from beneath this line then only the two families on the left hand namely a14 etc. and b14 etc. would have to be united into one family and the two other families namely a14 to f14 now including five genera and o14 to m14 would yet remain distinct. these two families however would be less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the fossils. if for instance we suppose the existing genera of the two families to differ from each other by a dozen characters in this case the genera at the early period marked vi. would differ by a lesser number of characters for at this early stage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common progenitor of the order nearly so much as they subsequently diverged. thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants or between their collateral relations. in nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the diagram for the groups will have been more numerous they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time and will have been modified in various degrees. as we possess only the last volume of the geological record and that in a very broken condition we have no right to expect except in very rare cases to fill up wide intervals in the natural system and thus unite distinct families or orders. all that we have a right to expect is that those groups which have within known geological periods undergone much modification should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of the same groups and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palontologists seems frequently to be the case. thus on the theory of descent with modification the main facts with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other and to living forms seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner. and they are wholly inexplicable on any other view. on this same theory it is evident that the fauna of any great period in the earths history will be intermediate in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it. thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below. we must however allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms and for the coming in of quite new forms by immigration and for a large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations. subject to these allowances the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas. i need give only one instance namely the manner in which the fossils of the devonian system when this system was first discovered were at once recognised by palontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous and underlying silurian system. but each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations. it is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule. for instance mastodons and elephants when arranged by dr. falconer in two series first according to their mutual affinities and then according to their periods of existence do not accord in arrangement. the species extreme in character are not the oldest or the most recent nor are those which are intermediate in character intermediate in age. but supposing for an instant in this and other such cases that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. to compare small things with great if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production and still less with the order of their disappearance for the parent rockpigeon now lives and many varieties between the rockpigeon and the carrier have become extinct and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated earlier than shortbeaked tumblers which are at the opposite end of the series in this same respect. closely connected with the statement that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character is the fact insisted on by all palontologists that fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other than are the fossils from two remote formations. pictet gives as a wellknown instance the general resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the chalk formation though the species are distinct in each stage. this fact alone from its generality seems to have shaken professor pictet in his firm belief in the immutability of species. he who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the globe will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely consecutive formations by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same. let it be remembered that the forms of life at least those inhabiting the sea have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world and therefore under the most different climates and conditions. consider the prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period which includes the whole glacial period and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected. on the theory of descent the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains from closely consecutive formations though ranked as distinct species being closely related is obvious. as the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations we ought not to expect to formations all the intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods but we ought to find after intervals very long as measured by years but only moderately long as measured geologically closely allied forms or as they have been called by some authors representative species and these we assuredly do find. we find in short such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of specific forms as we have a just right to expect to find. on the state of development of ancient forms.there has been much discussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient. i will not here enter on this subject for naturalists have not as yet defined to each others satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms. but in one particular sense the more recent forms must on my theory be higher than the more ancient for each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for life over other and preceding forms. if under a nearly similar climate the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter the eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated as would a secondary fauna by an eocene and a palozoic fauna by a secondary fauna. i do not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of life in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms but i can see no way of testing this sort of progress. crustaceans for instance not the highest in their own class may have beaten the highest molluscs. from the extraordinary manner in which european productions have recently spread over new zealand and have seized on places which must have been previously occupied we may believe if all the animals and plants of great britain were set free in new zealand that in the course of time a multitude of british forms would become thoroughly naturalized there and would exterminate many of the natives. on the other hand from what we see now occurring in new zealand and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere having become wild in any part of europe we may doubt if all the productions of new zealand were set free in great britain whether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants and animals. under this point of view the productions of great britain may be said to be higher than those of new zealand. yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of the two countries could not have foreseen this result. agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals of the same classes or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological development of recent forms. i must follow pictet and huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved. yet i fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed at least in regard to subordinate groups which have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times. for this doctrine of agassiz accords attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo owing to variations supervening at a not early age and being inherited at a corresponding age. this process whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered continually adds in the course of successive generations more and more difference to the adult. thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture preserved by nature of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. this view may be true and yet it may never be capable of full proof. seeing for instance that the oldest known mammals reptiles and fish strictly belong to their own proper classes though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological character of the vertebrata until beds far beneath the lowest silurian strata are discovereda discovery of which the chance is very small. on the succession of the same types within the same areas during the later tertiary periods.mr. clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that continent. in south america a similar relationship is manifest even to an uneducated eye in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the armadillo found in several parts of la plata and professor owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals buried there in such numbers are related to south american types. this relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by mm. lund and clausen in the caves of brazil. i was so much impressed with these facts that i strongly insisted in 1839 and 1845 on this law of the succession of typeson this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living. professor owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the old world. we see the same law in this authors restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of new zealand. we see it also in the birds of the caves of brazil. mr. woodward has shown that the same law holds good with seashells but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs it is not well displayed by them. other cases could be added as the relation between the extinct and living landshells of madeira and between the extinct and living brackishwater shells of the aralocaspian sea. now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types within the same areas mean? he would be a bold man who after comparing the present climate of australia and of parts of south america under the same latitude would attempt to account on the one hand by dissimilar physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents and on the other hand by similarity of conditions for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods. nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in australia or that edentata and other american types should have been solely produced in south america. for we know that europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials and i have shown in the publications above alluded to that in america the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it now is. north america formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of the continent and the southern half was formerly more closely allied than it is at present to the northern half. in a similar manner we know from falconer and cautleys discoveries that northern india was formerly more closely related in its mammals to africa than it is at the present time. analogous facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals. on the theory of descent with modification the great law of the long enduring but not immutable succession of the same types within the same areas is at once explained for the inhabitants of each quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter during the next succeeding period of time closely allied though in some degree modified descendants. if the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another continent so will their modified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree. but after very long intervals of time and after great geographical changes permitting much intermigration the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present distribution.  it may be asked in ridicule whether i suppose that the megatherium and other allied huge monsters have left behind them in south america the sloth armadillo and anteater as their degenerate descendants. this cannot for an instant be admitted. these huge animals have become wholly extinct and have left no progeny. but in the caves of brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other characters to the species still living in south america and some of these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species. it must not be forgotten that on my theory all the species of the same genus have descended from some one species so that if six genera each having eight species be found in one geological formation and in the next succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same number of species then we may conclude that only one species of each of the six older genera has left modified descendants constituting the six new genera. the other seven species of the old genera have all died out and have left no progeny. or which would probably be a far commoner case two or three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six new genera the other old species and the other whole genera having become utterly extinct. in failing orders with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as apparently is the case of the edentata of south america still fewer genera and species will have left modified blooddescendants. show that the geological record is extremely imperfect that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with care that only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state that the number both of specimens and of species preserved in our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation that owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation enormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence and more variation during the periods of elevation and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept that each single formation has not been continuously deposited that the duration of each formation is perhaps short compared with the average duration of specific forms that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation that widely ranging species are those which have varied most and have oftenest given rise to new species and that varieties have at first often been local. all these causes taken conjointly must have tended to make the geological record extremely imperfect and will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps. he who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record will rightly reject my whole theory. for he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species found in the several stages of the same great formation. he may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations he may overlook how important a part migration must have played when the formations of any one great region alone as that of europe are considered he may urge the apparent but often falsely apparent sudden coming in of whole groups of species. he may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited i can answer this latter question only hypothetically by saying that as far as we can see where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the silurian epoch but that long before that period the world may have presented a wholly different aspect and that the older continents formed of formations older than any known to us may now all be in a metamorphosed condition or may lie buried under the ocean. passing from these difficulties all the other great leading facts in palontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with modification through natural selection. we can thus understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively how species of different classes do not necessarily change together or at the same rate or in the same degree yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some extent. the extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. we can understand why when a species has once disappeared it never reappears. groups of species increase in numbers slowly and endure for unequal periods of time for the process of modification is necessarily slow and depends on many complex contingencies. the dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants and thus new subgroups and groups are formed. as these are formed the species of the less vigorous groups from their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor tend to become extinct together and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. but the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process from the survival of a few descendants lingering in protected and isolated situations. when a group has once wholly disappeared it does not reappear for the link of generation has been broken. we can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life which are those that oftenest vary will in the long run tend to people the world with allied but modified descendants and these will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence. hence after long intervals of time the productions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously. we can understand how it is that all the forms of life ancient and recent make together one grand system for all are connected by generation. we can understand from the continued tendency to divergence of character why the more ancient a form is the more it generally differs from those now living. why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms sometimes blending two groups previously classed as distinct into one but more commonly only bringing them a little closer together. the more ancient a form is the more often apparently it displays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct for the more ancient a form is the more nearly it will be related to and consequently resemble the common progenitor of groups since become widely divergent. extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms. we can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other than are those of remote formations for the forms are more closely linked together by generation we can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in character. the inhabitants of each successive period in the worlds history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life and are in so far higher in the scale of nature and this may account for that vague yet illdefined sentiment felt by many palontologists that organisation on the whole has progressed. if it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class the fact will be intelligible. the succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious and is simply explained by inheritance. if then the geological record be as imperfect as i believe it to be and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more perfect the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly diminished or disappear. on the other hand all the chief laws of palontology plainly proclaim as it seems to me that species have been produced by ordinary generation old forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life produced by the laws of variation still acting round us and preserved by natural selection.   geographical distribution.  present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical conditions. importance of barriers. affinity of the productions of the same continent. centres of creation. means of dispersal by changes of climate and of the level of the land and by occasional means. dispersal during the glacial period coextensive with the world.  in considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe the first great fact which strikes us is that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions. of late almost every author who has studied the subject has come to this conclusion. the case of america alone would almost suffice to prove its truth for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is almost continuous all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the new and old worlds yet if we travel over the vast american continent from the central parts of the united states to its extreme southern point we meet with the most diversified conditions the most humid districts arid deserts lofty mountains grassy plains forests marshes lakes and great rivers under almost every temperature. there is hardly a climate or condition in the old world which cannot be paralleled in the newat least as closely as the same species generally require for it is a most rare case to find a group of organisms confined to any small spot having conditions peculiar in only a slight degree for instance small areas in the old world could be pointed out hotter than any in the new world yet these are not inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora. notwithstanding this parallelism in the conditions of the old and new worlds how widely different are their living productions! in the southern hemisphere if we compare large tracts of land in australia south africa and western south america between latitudes 25 and 35 we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar. or again we may compare the productions of south america south of lat. 35 with those north of 25 which consequently inhabit a considerably different climate and they will be found incomparably more closely related to each other than they are to the productions of australia or africa under nearly the same climate. analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea. a second great fact which strikes us in our general review is that barriers of any kind or obstacles to free migration are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions. we see this in the great difference of nearly all the terrestrial productions of the new and old worlds excepting in the northern parts where the land almost joins and where under a slightly different climate there might have been free migration for the northern temperate forms as there now is for the strictly arctic productions. we see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of australia africa and south america under the same latitude for these countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. on each continent also we see the same fact for on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountainranges and of great deserts and sometimes even of large rivers we find different productions though as mountain chains deserts etc. are not as impassable or likely to have endured so long as the oceans separating continents the differences are very inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents. turning to the sea we find the same law. no two marine faunas are more distinct with hardly a fish shell or crab in common than those of the eastern and western shores of south and central america yet these great faunas are separated only by the narrow but impassable isthmus of panama. westward of the shores of america a wide space of open ocean extends with not an island as a haltingplace for emigrants here we have a barrier of another kind and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the pacific with another and totally distinct fauna. so that here three marine faunas range far northward and southward in parallel lines not far from each other under corresponding climates but from being separated from each other by impassable barriers either of land or open sea they are wholly distinct. on the other hand proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the pacific we encounter no impassable barriers and we have innumerable islands as haltingplaces until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of africa and over this vast space we meet with no welldefined and distinct marine faunas. although hardly one shell crab or fish is common to the abovenamed three approximate faunas of eastern and western america and the eastern pacific islands yet many fish range from the pacific into the indian ocean and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the pacific and the eastern shores of africa on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude. a third great fact partly included in the foregoing statements is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or sea though the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations. it is a law of the widest generality and every continent offers innumerable instances. nevertheless the naturalist in travelling for instance from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings specifically distinct yet clearly related replace each other. he hears from closely allied yet distinct kinds of birds notes nearly similar and sees their nests similarly constructed but not quite alike with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. the plains near the straits of magellan are inhabited by one species of rhea american ostrich and northward the plains of la plata by another species of the same genus and not by a true ostrich or emeu like those found in africa and australia under the same latitude. on these same plains of la plata we see the agouti and bizcacha animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of rodents but they plainly display an american type of structure. we ascend the lofty peaks of the cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha we look to the waters and we do not find the beaver or muskrat but the coypu and capybara rodents of the american type. innumerable other instances could be given. if we look to the islands off the american shore however much they may differ in geological structure the inhabitants though they may be all peculiar species are essentially american. we american types then prevalent on the american continent and in the american seas. we see in these facts some deep organic bond prevailing throughout space and time over the same areas of land and water and independent of their physical conditions. the naturalist must feel little curiosity who is not led to inquire what this bond is. this bond on my theory is simply inheritance that cause which alone as far as we positively know produces organisms quite like or as we see in the case of varieties nearly like each other. the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through natural selection and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct influence of different physical conditions. the degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having been effected with more or less ease at periods more or less remoteon the nature and number of the former immigrantsand on their action and reaction in their mutual struggles for lifethe relation of organism to organism being as i have already often remarked the most important of all relations. thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by checking migration as does time for the slow process of modification through natural selection. widelyranging species abounding in individuals which have already triumphed over many competitors in their own widelyextended homes will have the best chance of seizing on new places when they spread into new countries. in their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions and will frequently undergo further modification and improvement and thus they will become still further victorious and will produce groups of modified descendants. on this principle of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is that sections of genera whole genera and even families are confined to the same areas as is so commonly and notoriously the case. development. as the variability of each species is an independent property and will be taken advantage of by natural selection only so far as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life so the degree of modification in different species will be no uniform quantity. if for instance a number of species which stand in direct competition with each other migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country they will be little liable to modification for neither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything. these principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser degree with the that some forms have retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological period so certain species have migrated over vast spaces and have not become greatly modified. on these views it is obvious that the several species of the same genus though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world must originally have proceeded from the same source as they have descended from the same progenitor. in the case of those species which have undergone during whole geological periods but little modification there is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the same region for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since ancient times almost any amount of migration is possible. but in many other cases in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times there is great difficulty on this head. it is also obvious that the individuals of the same species though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions must have proceeded from one spot where their parents were first produced for as explained in the should ever have been produced through natural selection from parents specifically distinct. we are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by naturalists namely whether species have been created at one or more points of the earths surface. undoubtedly there are very many cases of extreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated points where now found. nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced within a single region captivates the mind. he who rejects it rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent migration and calls in the agency of a miracle. it is universally admitted that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is continuous and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from each other or with an interval of such a nature that the space could not be easily passed over by migration the fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional. the capacity of migrating across the sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals than perhaps in any other organic beings and accordingly we find no inexplicable cases of the same mammal inhabiting distant points of the world. no geologist will feel any difficulty in such cases as great britain having been formerly united to europe and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds. but if the same species can be produced at two separate points why do we not find a single mammal common to europe and australia or south america? the conditions of life are nearly the same so that a multitude of european animals and plants have become naturalised in america and australia and some of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and southern hemispheres? the answer as i believe is that mammals have not been able to migrate whereas some plants from their varied means of dispersal have migrated across the vast and broken interspace. the great and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had on distribution is intelligible only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced on one side alone and have not been able to migrate to the other side. some few families many subfamilies very many genera and a still greater number of sections of genera are confined to a single region and it has been observed by several naturalists that the most natural genera or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each other are generally local or confined to one area. what a strange anomaly it would be if when coming one step lower in the series to the individuals of the same species a directly opposite rule prevailed and species were not local but had been produced in two or more distinct areas! hence it seems to me as it has to many other naturalists that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted is the most probable. undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other. but the geographical and climatal changes which have certainly occurred within recent geological times must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of many species. so that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature that we ought to give up the belief rendered probable by general considerations that each species has been produced within one area and has migrated thence as far as it could. it would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species now living at distant and separated points nor do i for a moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases. but after some preliminary remarks i will discuss a few of the most striking classes of facts namely the existence of the same species on the summits of distant mountainranges and at distant points in the arctic wide distribution of freshwater productions and thirdly the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the mainland though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. if the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earths surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace then considering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and various occasional means of transport the belief that this has been the universal law seems to me incomparably the safest. in discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to consider a point equally important for us namely whether the several distinct species of a genus which on my theory have all descended from a common progenitor can have migrated undergoing modification during some part of their migration from the area inhabited by their progenitor. if it can be shown to be almost invariably the case that a region of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region has probably received at some former period immigrants from this other region my theory will be strengthened for we can clearly understand on the principle of modification why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of another region whence it has been stocked. a volcanic island for instance upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent would probably receive from it in the course of time a few colonists and their descendants though modified would still be plainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent. cases of this nature are common and are as we shall hereafter more fully see inexplicable on the theory of independent creation. this view of the relation of species in one region to those in another does not differ much by substituting the word variety for species from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper by mr. wallace in which he concludes that every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a preexisting closely allied species. and i now know from correspondence that this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification. the previous remarks on single and multiple centres of creation do not directly bear on another allied questionnamely whether all the individuals of the same species have descended from a single pair or single hermaphrodite or whether as some authors suppose from many individuals simultaneously created. with those organic beings which never intercross if such exist the species on my theory must have descended from a succession of improved varieties which will never have blended with other individuals or varieties but will have supplanted each other so that at each successive stage of modification and improvement all the individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent. but in the majority of cases namely with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth or which often intercross i believe that during the slow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform by intercrossing so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneously changing and the whole amount of modification will not have been due at each stage to descent from a single parent. to illustrate what i mean our english racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every other breed but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations. before discussing the three classes of facts which i have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of single centres of creation i must say a few words on the means of dispersal. means of dispersal.sir c. lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. i can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts. change of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration a region when its climate was different may have been a high road for migration but now be impassable i shall however presently have to discuss this branch of the subject in some detail. changes of level in the land must also have been highly influential a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas submerge it or let it formerly have been submerged and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended where the sea now extends land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even continents together and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. no geologist will dispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms. edward forbes insisted that all the islands in the atlantic must recently have been connected with europe or africa and europe likewise with america. other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean and have united almost every island to some mainland. if indeed the arguments used by forbes are to be trusted it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to some continent. this view cuts the gordian knot of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points and removes many a difficulty but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species. it seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations of level in our continents but not of such vast changes in their position and extension as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. i freely admit the former existence of many islands now buried beneath the sea which may have served as halting places for plants and for many animals during their migration. in the coralproducing oceans such sunken islands are now marked as i believe by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. whenever it is fully admitted as i believe it will some day be that each species has proceeded from a single birthplace and when in the course of time we know something definite about the means of distribution we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land. but i do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent period continents which are now quite separate have been continuously or almost continuously united with each other and with the many existing oceanic islands. several facts in distributionsuch as the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continentthe close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitantsa certain degree of relation as we shall hereafter see between the distribution of mammals and the depth of the seathese and other such facts seem to me opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period as are necessitated on the view advanced by forbes and admitted by his many followers. the nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents. nor does their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken continentsif they had originally existed as mountainranges on the land some at least of the islands would have been formed like other mountainsummits of granite metamorphic schists old fossiliferous or other such rocks instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter. i must now say a few words on what are called accidental means but which more properly might be called occasional means of distribution. i shall here confine myself to plants. in botanical works this or that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination but for transport across the sea the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly unknown. until i tried with mr. berkeleys aid a few experiments it was not even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of seawater. to my surprise i found that out of 87 kinds 64 germinated after an immersion of 28 days and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. for convenience sake i chiefly tried small seeds without the capsule or fruit and as all of these sank in a few days they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea whether or not they were injured by the saltwater. afterwards i tried some larger fruits capsules etc. and some of these floated for a long time. it is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber and it occurred to me that floods might wash down plants or branches and that these might be dried on the banks and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea. hence i was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit and to place them on sea water. the majority sank quickly but some which whilst green floated for a very short time when dried floated much longer for instance ripe hazelnuts sank immediately but when dried they floated for 90 days and afterwards when planted they germinated an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23 days when dried it floated for 85 days and the seeds afterwards germinated the ripe seeds of helosciadium sank in two days when dried they floated for above 90 days and afterwards germinated. altogether out of the 94 dried plants 18 floated for above 28 days and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period. so that as 6487 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days and as 1894 plants with ripe fruit but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment floated after being dried for above 28 days as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts we may conclude that the seeds of 14100 plants of any country might be floated by seacurrents during 28 days and would retain their power of germination. in johnstons physical atlas the average rate of the several atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem on this average the seeds of 14100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country and when stranded if blown to a favourable spot by an inland gale they would germinate. subsequently to my experiments m. martens tried similar ones but in a much better manner for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. he tried 98 seeds mostly different from mine but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the saltwater. on the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit and this as we have seen would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. the result was that 1898 of his seeds floated for 42 days and were then capable of germination. but i do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about 10100 plants of a flora after having been dried could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width and would then germinate. the fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small is interesting as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means and alph. de candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges. but seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. drift timber is thrown up on most islands even on those in the midst of the widest oceans and the natives of the coralislands in the pacific procure stones for their tools solely from the roots of drifted trees these stones being a valuable royal tax. i find on examination that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind themso perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest transport out of one small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old three dicotyledonous plants germinated i am certain of the accuracy of this observation. again i can show that the carcasses of birds when floating on the sea sometimes escape being immediately devoured and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality peas and vetches for instance are killed by even a few days immersion in seawater but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon which had floated on artificial saltwater for 30 days to my surprise nearly all germinated. living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds. i could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean. we may i think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour and some authors have given a far higher estimate. i have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird but hard seeds of fruit will pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. in the course of two months i picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds out of the excrement of small birds and these seemed perfect and some of them which i tried germinated. but the following fact is more important the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice and do not in the least injure as i know by trial the germination of seeds now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours. a bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles and hawks are known to look out for tired birds and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. mr. brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up flying carrierpigeons from france to england as the hawks on the english coast destroyed so many on their arrival. some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole and after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours disgorge pellets which as i know from experiments made in the zoological gardens include seeds capable of germination. some seeds of the oat wheat millet canary hemp clover and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twentyone hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours. freshwater fish i find eat seeds of many land and water plants fish are frequently devoured by birds and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place. i forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish and then gave their bodies to fishingeagles storks and pelicans these birds after an interval of many hours either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement and several of these seeds retained their power of germination. certain seeds however were always killed by this process. although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean i can show that earth sometimes adheres to them in one instance i removed twentytwo grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch. thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great distances for many facts could be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds. reflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the mediterranean and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minute seeds? but i shall presently have to recur to this subject. as icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones and have even carried brushwood bones and the nest of a landbird i can hardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions as suggested by lyell and during the glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another. in the azores from the large number of the species of plants common to europe in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands nearer to the mainland and as remarked by mr. h. c. watson from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude i suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by iceborne seeds during the glacial epoch. at my request sir c. lyell wrote to m. hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands and he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks which do not occur in the archipelago. hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these midocean islands and it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of northern plants. considering that the several above means of transport and that several other means which without doubt remain to be discovered have been in action year after year for centuries and tens of thousands of years it would i think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported. these means of transport are sometimes called accidental but this is not strictly correct the currents of the sea are not accidental nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. it should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of seawater nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds. these means however would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth or from island to island or from a continent to a neighbouring island but not from one distant continent to another. the floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great degree but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be. the currents from their course would never bring seeds from north america to britain though they might and do bring seeds from the west indies to our western shores where if not killed by so long an immersion in saltwater they could not endure our climate. almost every year one or two landbirds are blown across the whole atlantic ocean from north america to the western shores of ireland and england but seeds could be transported by these wanderers only by one means namely in dirt sticking to their feet which is in itself a rare accident. even in this case how small would the chance be of a seed falling on favourable soil and coming to maturity! but it would be a great error to argue that because a wellstocked island like great britain has not as far as is known and it would be very difficult to prove this received within the last few centuries through occasional means of transport immigrants from europe or any other continent that a poorlystocked island though standing more remote from the mainland would not receive colonists by similar means. i do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island even if far less wellstocked than britain scarcely more than one would be so well fitted to its new home as to become naturalised. but this as it seems to me is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means of transport during the long lapse of geological time whilst an island was being upheaved and formed and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. on almost bare land with few or no destructive insects or birds living there nearly every seed which chanced to arrive would be sure to germinate and survive. dispersal during the glacial period.the identity of many plants and animals on mountainsummits separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands where the alpine species could not possibly exist is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant points without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one to the other. it is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy regions of the alps or pyrenees and in the extreme northern parts of europe but it is far more remarkable that the plants on the white mountains in the united states of america are all the same with those of labrador and nearly all the same as we hear from asa gray with those on the loftiest mountains of europe. even as long ago as 1747 such facts led gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been independently created at several distinct points and we might have remained in this same belief had not agassiz and others called vivid attention to the glacial period which as we shall immediately see affords a simple explanation of these facts. we have evidence of almost every conceivable kind organic and inorganic that within a very recent geological period central europe and north america suffered under an arctic climate. the ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale more plainly than do the mountains of scotland and wales with their scored flanks polished surfaces and perched boulders of the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled. so greatly has the climate of europe changed that in northern italy gigantic moraines left by old glaciers are now clothed by the vine and maize. throughout a large part of the united states erratic boulders and rocks scored by drifted icebergs and coastice plainly reveal a former cold period. the former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the inhabitants of europe as explained with remarkable clearness by edward forbes is substantially as follows. but we shall follow the changes more readily by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on and then pass away as formerly occurred. as the cold came on and as each more southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and illfitted for their former more temperate inhabitants the latter would be supplanted and arctic productions would take their places. the inhabitants of the more temperate regions would at the same time travel southward unless they were stopped by barriers in which case they would perish. the mountains would become covered with snow and ice and their former alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains. by the time that the cold had reached its maximum we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora covering the central parts of europe as far south as the alps and pyrenees and even stretching into spain. the now temperate regions of the united states would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and these would be nearly the same with those of europe for the present circumpolar inhabitants which we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward are remarkably uniform round the world. we may suppose that the glacial period came on a little earlier or later in north america than in europe so will the southern migration there have been a little earlier or later but this will make no difference in the final result. as the warmth returned the arctic forms would retreat northward closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate regions. and as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground always ascending higher and higher as the warmth increased whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey. hence when the warmth had fully returned the same arctic species which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands of the old and new worlds would be left isolated on distant mountainsummits having been exterminated on all lesser heights and in the arctic regions of both hemispheres. thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as on the mountains of the united states and of europe. we can thus also understand the fact that the alpine plants of each mountainrange are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due north of them for the migration as the cold came on and the remigration on the returning warmth will generally have been due south and north. the alpine plants for example of scotland as remarked by mr. h. c. watson and those of the pyrenees as remarked by ramond are more especially allied to the plants of northern scandinavia those of the united states to labrador those of the mountains of siberia to the arctic regions of that country. these views grounded as they are on the perfectly wellascertained occurrence of a former glacial period seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the alpine and arctic productions of europe and america that when in other regions we find the same species on distant mountainsummits we may almost conclude without other evidence that a colder climate permitted their former migration across the low intervening tracts since become too warm for their existence. if the climate since the glacial period has ever been in any degree warmer than at present as some geologists in the united states believe to have been the case chiefly from the distribution of the fossil gnathodon then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have marched a little further north and subsequently have retreated to their present homes but i have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period since the glacial period. the arctic forms during their long southern migration and remigration northward will have been exposed to nearly the same climate and as is especially to be noticed they will have kept in a body together consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed and in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume they will not have been liable to much modification. but with our alpine productions left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains the case will have been somewhat different for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other and have survived there ever since they will also in all probability have become mingled with ancient alpine species which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the glacial epoch and which during its coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains they will also have been exposed to somewhat different climatal influences. their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed consequently they will have been liable to modification and this we find has been the case for if we compare the present alpine plants and animals of the several great european mountainranges though very many of the species are identically the same some present varieties some are ranked as doubtful forms and some few are distinct yet closely allied or representative species. in illustrating what as i believe actually took place during the glacial period i assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day. but the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms but also to many subarctic and to some few northern temperate forms for some of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of north america and europe and it may be reasonably asked how i account for the necessary degree of uniformity of the subarctic and northern temperate forms round the world at the commencement of the glacial period. at the present day the subarctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds are separated from each other by the atlantic ocean and by the extreme northern part of the pacific. during the glacial period when the inhabitants of the old and new worlds lived further southwards than at present they must have been still more completely separated by wider spaces of ocean. i believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by looking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature. we have good reason to believe that during the newer pliocene period before the glacial epoch and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now the climate was warmer than at the present day. hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate of latitude 60 during the pliocene period lived further north under the polar circle in latitude 6667 and that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. now if we look at a globe we shall see that under the polar circle there is almost continuous land from western europe through siberia to eastern america. and to this continuity of the circumpolar land and to the consequent freedom for intermigration under a more favourable climate i attribute the necessary amount of uniformity in the subarctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds at a period anterior to the glacial epoch. believing from reasons before alluded to that our continents have long remained in nearly the same relative position though subjected to large but partial oscillations of level i am strongly inclined to extend the above view and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period such as the older pliocene period a large number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land and that these plants and animals both in the old and new worlds began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm long before the commencement of the glacial period. we now see as i believe their descendants mostly in a modified condition in the central parts of europe and the united states. on this view we can understand the relationship with very little identity between the productions of north america and europea relationship which is most remarkable considering the distance of the two areas and their separation by the atlantic ocean. we can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers that the productions of europe and america during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the old and new worlds will have been almost continuously united by land serving as a bridge since rendered impassable by cold for the intermigration of their inhabitants. during the slowly decreasing warmth of the pliocene period as soon as the species in common which inhabited the new and old worlds migrated south of the polar circle they must have been completely cut off from each other. this separation as far as the more temperate productions are concerned took place long ages ago. and as the plants and animals migrated southward they will have become mingled in the one great region with the native american productions and have had to compete with them and in the other great region with those of the old world. consequently we have here everything favourable for much modificationfor far more modification than with the alpine productions left isolated within a much more recent period on the several mountainranges and on the arctic lands of the two worlds. hence it has come that when we compare the now living productions of the temperate regions of the new and old worlds we find very few identical species though asa gray has lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly supposed but we find in every great class many forms which some naturalists rank as geographical races and others as distinct species and a host of closely allied or representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct. as on the land so in the waters of the sea a slow southern migration of a marine fauna which during the pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the polar circle will account on the theory of modification for many closely allied forms now living in areas completely sundered. thus i think we can understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern and western shores of temperate north america and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans as described in danas admirable work of some fish and other marine animals in the mediterranean and in the seas of japanareas now separated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean. these cases of relationship without identity of the inhabitants of seas now disjoined and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the temperate lands of north america and europe are inexplicable on the theory of creation. we cannot say that they have been created alike in correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas for if we compare for instance certain parts of south america with the southern continents of the old world we see countries closely corresponding in all their physical conditions but with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar. but we must return to our more immediate subject the glacial period. i am convinced that forbess view may be largely extended. in europe we have the plainest evidence of the cold period from the western shores of britain to the oural range and southward to the pyrenees. we may infer from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation that siberia was similarly affected. along the himalaya at points 900 miles apart glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent and in sikkim dr. hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines. south of the equator we have some direct evidence of former glacial action in new zealand and the same plants found on widely separated mountains in this island tell the same story. if one account which has been published can be trusted we have direct evidence of glacial action in the southeastern corner of australia. looking to america in the northern half iceborne fragments of rock have been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat. 3637 and on the shores of the pacific where the climate is now so different as far south as lat. 46 deg erratic boulders have also been noticed on the rocky mountains. in the cordillera of equatorial south america glaciers once extended far below their present level. in central chile i was astonished at the structure of a vast mound of detritus about 800 feet in height crossing a valley of the andes and this i now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine left far below any existing glacier. further south on both sides of the continent from lat. 41 to the southernmost extremity we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action in huge boulders transported far from their parent source. we do not know that the glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these several far distant points on opposite sides of the world. but we have good evidence in almost every case that the epoch was included within the latest geological period. we have also excellent evidence that it endured for an enormous time as measured by years at each point. the cold may have come on or have ceased earlier at one point of the globe than at another but seeing that it endured for long at each and that it was contemporaneous in a geological sense it seems to me probable that it was during a part at least of the period actually simultaneous throughout the world. without some distinct evidence to the contrary we may at least admit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern and western sides of north america in the cordillera under the equator and under the warmer temperate zones and on both sides of the southern extremity of the continent. if this be admitted it is difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the whole world was at this period simultaneously cooler. but it would suffice for my purpose if the temperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of longitude. on this view of the whole world or at least of broad longitudinal belts having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole much light can be thrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species. in america dr. hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of tierra del fuego forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora are common to europe enormously remote as these two points are and there are many closely allied species. on the lofty mountains of equatorial america a host of peculiar species belonging to european genera occur. on the highest mountains of brazil some few european genera were found by gardner which do not exist in the wide intervening hot countries. so on the silla of caraccas the illustrious humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera characteristic of the cordillera. on the mountains of abyssinia several european forms and some few representatives of the peculiar flora of the cape of good hope occur. at the cape of good hope a very few european species believed not to have been introduced by man and on the mountains some few representative european forms are found which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of africa. on the himalaya and on the isolated mountainranges of the peninsula of india on the heights of ceylon and on the volcanic cones of java many plants occur either identically the same or representing each other and at the same time representing plants of europe not found in the intervening hot lowlands. a list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of java raises a picture of a collection made on a hill in europe! still more striking is the fact that southern australian forms are clearly represented by plants growing on the summits of the mountains of borneo. some of these australian forms as i hear from dr. hooker extend along the heights of the peninsula of malacca and are thinly scattered on the one hand over india and on the other as far north as japan. on the southern mountains of australia dr. f. mller has discovered several european species other species not introduced by man occur on the lowlands and a long list can be given as i am informed by dr. hooker of european genera found in australia but not in the intermediate torrid regions. in the admirable introduction to the flora of new zealand by dr. hooker analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants of that large island. hence we see that throughout the world the plants growing on the more lofty mountains and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern hemispheres are sometimes identically the same but they are much oftener specifically distinct though related to each other in a most remarkable manner. this brief abstract applies to plants alone some strictly analogous facts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals. in marine productions similar cases occur as an example i may quote a remark by the highest authority professor dana that it is certainly a wonderful fact that new zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea to great britain its antipode than to any other part of the world. sir j. richardson also speaks of the reappearance on the shores of new zealand tasmania etc. of northern forms of fish. dr. hooker informs me that twentyfive species of alg are common to new zealand and to europe but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas. it should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the southern parts of the southern hemisphere and on the mountainranges of the intertropical regions are not arctic but belong to the northern temperate zones. as mr. h. c. watson has recently remarked in receding from polar towards equatorial latitudes the alpine or mountain floras really become less and less arctic. many of the forms living on the mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere are of doubtful value being ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct by others as varieties but some are certainly identical and many though closely related to northern forms must be ranked as distinct species. now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts on the belief supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence that the whole world or a large part of it was during the glacial period simultaneously much colder than at present. the glacial period as measured by years must have been very long and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few centuries this period will have been ample for any amount of migration. as the cold came slowly on all the tropical plants and other productions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator followed in the rear by the temperate productions and these by the arctic but with the latter we are not now concerned. the tropical plants probably suffered much extinction how much no one can say perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the cape of good hope and in parts of temperate australia. as we know that many tropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold many might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of temperature more especially by escaping into the warmest spots. but the great fact to bear in mind is that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. on the other hand the temperate productions after migrating nearer to the equator though they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions will have suffered less. and it is certain that many temperate plants if protected from the inroads of competitors can withstand a much warmer climate than their own. hence it seems to me possible bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against intruders that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached or even crossed the equator. the invasion would of course have been greatly favoured by high land and perhaps by a dry climate for dr. falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate. on the other hand the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded an asylum to the tropical natives. the mountainranges northwest of the himalaya and the long line of the cordillera seem to have afforded two great lines of invasion and it is a striking fact lately communicated to me by dr. hooker that all the flowering plants about fortysix in number common to tierra del fuego and to europe still exist in north america which must have lain on the line of march. but i do not doubt that some temperate productions entered and crossed even the lowlands of the tropics at the period when the cold was most intensewhen arctic forms had migrated some twentyfive degrees of latitude from their native country and covered the land at the foot of the pyrenees. at this period of extreme cold i believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven thousand feet. during this the coldest period i suppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of the himalaya as graphically described by hooker. thus as i believe a considerable number of plants a few terrestrial animals and some marine productions migrated during the glacial period from the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical regions and some even crossed the equator. as the warmth returned these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains being exterminated on the lowlands those which had not reached the equator would remigrate northward or southward towards their former homes but the forms chiefly northern which had crossed the equator would travel still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere. although we have reason to believe from geological evidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification during their long southern migration and remigration northward the case may have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains and in the southern hemisphere. these being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new forms of life and it is probable that selected modifications in their structure habits and constitutions will have profited them. thus many of these wanderers though still plainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or southern hemispheres now exist in their new homes as wellmarked varieties or as distinct species. it is a remarkable fact strongly insisted on by hooker in regard to america and by alph. de candolle in regard to australia that many more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south than in a reversed direction. we see however a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of borneo and abyssinia. i suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power than the southern forms. and thus when they became commingled during the glacial period the northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southern forms. just in the same manner as we see at the present day that very many european productions cover the ground in la plata and in a lesser degree in australia and have to a certain extent beaten the natives whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part of europe though hides wool and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into europe during the last two or three centuries from la plata and during the last thirty or forty years from australia. something of the same kind must have occurred on the intertropical mountains no doubt before the glacial period they were stocked with endemic alpine forms but these have almost everywhere largely yielded to the more dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north. in many islands the native productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised and if the natives have not been actually exterminated their numbers have been greatly reduced and this is the first stage towards extinction. a mountain is an island on the land and the intertropical mountains before the glacial period must have been completely isolated and i believe that the productions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north just in the same way as the productions of real islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms naturalised by mans agency. i am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the intertropical regions. very many difficulties remain to be solved. i do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and means of migration or the reason why certain species and not others have migrated why certain species have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms and others have remained unaltered. we cannot hope to explain such facts until we can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by mans agency in a foreign land why one ranges twice or thrice as far and is twice or thrice as common as another species within their own homes. i have said that many difficulties remain to be solved some of the most remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by dr. hooker in his botanical works on the antarctic regions. these cannot be here discussed. i will only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at points so enormously remote as kerguelen land new zealand and fuegia i believe that towards the close of the glacial period icebergs as suggested by lyell have been largely concerned in their dispersal. but the existence of several quite distinct species belonging to genera exclusively confined to the south at these and other distant points of the southern hemisphere is on my theory of descent with modification a far more remarkable case of difficulty. for some of these species are so distinct that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the commencement of the glacial period for their migration and for their subsequent modification to the necessary degree. the facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre and i am inclined to look in the southern as in the northern hemisphere to a former and warmer period before the commencement of the glacial period when the antarctic lands now covered with ice supported a highly peculiar and isolated flora. i suspect that before this flora was exterminated by the glacial epoch a few forms were widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport and by the aid as haltingplaces of existing and now sunken islands and perhaps at the commencement of the glacial period by icebergs. by these means as i believe the southern shores of america australia new zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of vegetable life. sir c. lyell in a striking passage has speculated in language almost identical with mine on the effects of great alternations of climate on geographical distribution. i believe that the world has recently felt one of his great cycles of change and that on this view combined with modification through natural selection a multitude of facts in the present distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained. the living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from the north and from the south and to have crossed at the equator but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely inundated the south. as the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines though rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountainsummits in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the equator. the various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man driven up and surviving in the mountainfastnesses of almost every land which serve as a record full of interest to us of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.   geographical distributioncontinued.  distribution of freshwater productions. on the inhabitants of oceanic islands. absence of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals. on the relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland. on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent  as lakes and riversystems are separated from each other by barriers of land it might have been thought that freshwater productions would not have ranged widely within the same country and as the sea is apparently a still more impassable barrier that they never would have extended to distant countries. but the case is exactly the reverse. not only have many freshwater species belonging to quite different classes an enormous range but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world. i well remember when first collecting in the fresh waters of brazil feeling much surprise at the similarity of the freshwater insects shells etc. and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial beings compared with those of britain. but this power in freshwater productions of ranging widely though so unexpected can i think in most cases be explained by their having become fitted in a manner highly useful to them for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond or from stream to stream and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. we can here consider only a few cases. in regard to fish i believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents. but on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously for two riversystems will have some fish in common and some different. a few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means like that of the live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in india and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water. but i am inclined to attribute the dispersal of freshwater fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land having caused rivers to flow into each other. instances also could be given of this having occurred during floods without any change of level. we have evidence in the loess of the rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period and when the surface was peopled by existing land and freshwater shells. the wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountainranges which from an early period must have parted riversystems and completely prevented their inosculation seems to lead to this same conclusion. with respect to allied freshwater fish occurring at very distant points of the world no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained but some freshwater fish belong to very ancient forms and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes and consequently time and means for much migration. in the second place saltwater fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water and according to valenciennes there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water so that we may imagine that a marine member of a freshwater group might travel far along the shores of the sea and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land. some species of freshwater shells have a very wide range and allied species which on my theory are descended from a common parent and must have proceeded from a single source prevail throughout the world. their distribution at first perplexed me much as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds and they are immediately killed by sea water as are the adults. i could not even understand how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country. but two facts which i have observedand no doubt many others remain to be observedthrow some light on this subject. when a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with duckweed i have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back and it has happened to me in removing a little duckweed from one aquarium to another that i have quite unintentionally stocked the one with freshwater shells from the other. but another agency is perhaps more effectual i suspended a ducks feet which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond in an aquarium where many ova of freshwater shells were hatching and i found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells crawled on the feet and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. these just hatched molluscs though aquatic in their nature survived on the ducks feet in damp air from twelve to twenty hours and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles and would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any other distant point. sir charles lyell also informs me that a dyticus has been caught with an ancylus a freshwater shell like a limpet firmly adhering to it and a waterbeetle of the same family a colymbetes once flew on board the beagle when fortyfive miles distant from the nearest land how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell. with respect to plants it has long been known what enormous ranges many freshwater and even marshspecies have both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands. this is strikingly shown as remarked by alph. de candolle in large groups of terrestrial plants which have only a very few aquatic members for these latter seem immediately to acquire as if in consequence a very wide range. i think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. i have before mentioned that earth occasionally though rarely adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. wading birds which frequent the muddy edges of ponds if suddenly flushed would be the most likely to have muddy feet. birds of this order i can show are the greatest wanderers and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open ocean they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet when making land they would be sure to fly to their natural freshwater haunts. i do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds i have tried several little experiments but will here give only the most striking case i took in february three tablespoonfuls of mud from three different points beneath water on the edge of a little pond this mud when dry weighed only 6 34 ounces i kept it covered up in my study for six months pulling up and counting each plant as it grew the plants were of many kinds and were altogether 537 in number and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! considering these facts i think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if waterbirds did not transport the seeds of freshwater plants to vast distances and if consequently the range of these plants was not very great. the same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller freshwater animals. other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. i have stated that freshwater fish eat some kinds of seeds though they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them even small fish swallow seeds of moderate size as of the yellow waterlily and potamogeton. herons and other birds century after century have gone on daily devouring fish they then take flight and go to other waters or are blown across the sea and we have seen that seeds retain their power of germination when rejected in pellets or in excrement many hours afterwards. when i saw the great size of the seeds of that fine waterlily the nelumbium and remembered alph. de candolles remarks on this plant i thought that its distribution must remain quite inexplicable but audubon states that he found the seeds of the great southern waterlily probably according to dr. hooker the nelumbium luteum in a herons stomach although i do not know the fact yet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting a hearty meal of fish would probably reject from its stomach a pellet containing the seeds of the nelumbium undigested or the seeds might be dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young in the same way as fish are known sometimes to be dropped. in considering these several means of distribution it should be remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed for instance on a rising islet it will be unoccupied and a single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding. although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species however few already occupying any pond yet as the number of kinds is small compared with those on the land the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country would have a better chance of seizing on a place than in the case of terrestrial colonists. we should also remember that some perhaps many freshwater productions are low in the scale of nature and that we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species. we should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as freshwater productions ever can range over immense areas and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. but the wide distribution of freshwater plants and of the lower animals whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified i believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals more especially by freshwater birds which have large powers of flight and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water. nature like a careful gardener thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature and drops them in another equally well fitted for them. on the inhabitants of oceanic islands.we now come to the last of the three classes of facts which i have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the view that all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have descended from a single parent and therefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace notwithstanding that in the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the globe. i have already stated that i cannot honestly admit forbess view on continental extensions which if legitimately followed out would lead to the belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined to some continent. this view would remove many difficulties but it would not i think explain all the facts in regard to insular productions. in the following remarks i shall not confine myself to the mere question of dispersal but shall consider some other facts which bear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with modification. the species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number compared with those on equal continental areas alph. de candolle admits this for plants and wollaston for insects. if we look to the large size and varied stations of new zealand extending over 780 miles of latitude and compare its flowering plants only 750 in number with those on an equal area at the cape of good hope or in australia we must i think admit that something quite independently of any difference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference in number. even the uniform county of cambridge has 847 plants and the little island of anglesea 764 but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers and the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. we have evidence that the barren island of ascension aboriginally possessed under halfadozen flowering plants yet many have become naturalised on it as they have on new zealand and on every other oceanic island which can be named. in st. helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native productions. he who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate species will have to admit that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands for man has unintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature. although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty the proportion of endemic species i.e. those found nowhere else in the world is often extremely large. if we compare for instance the number of the endemic landshells in madeira or of the endemic birds in the galapagos archipelago with the number found on any continent and then compare the area of the islands with that of the continent we shall see that this is true. this fact might have been expected on my theory for as already explained species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a new and isolated district and having to compete with new associates will be eminently liable to modification and will often produce groups of modified descendants. but it by no means follows that because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar those of another class or of another section of the same class are peculiar and this difference seems to depend on the species which do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in a body so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed. thus in the galapagos islands nearly every landbird but only two out of the eleven marine birds are peculiar and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than landbirds. bermuda on the other hand which lies at about the same distance from north america as the galapagos islands do from south america and which has a very peculiar soil does not possess one endemic land bird and we know from mr. j. m. joness admirable account of bermuda that very many north american birds during their great annual migrations visit either periodically or occasionally this island. madeira does not possess one peculiar bird and many european and african birds are almost every year blown there as i am informed by mr. e. v. harcourt. so that these two islands of bermuda and madeira have been stocked by birds which for long ages have struggled together in their former homes and have become mutually adapted to each other and when settled in their new homes each kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits and will consequently have been little liable to modification. madeira again is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar landshells whereas not one species of seashell is confined to its shores now though we do not know how seashells are dispersed yet we can see that their eggs or larv perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber or to the feet of wadingbirds might be transported far more easily than landshells across three or four hundred miles of open sea. the different orders of insects in madeira apparently present analogous facts. oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes and their places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants in the galapagos islands reptiles and in new zealand gigantic wingless birds take the place of mammals. in the plants of the galapagos islands dr. hooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere. such cases are generally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands but this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful. facility of immigration i believe has been at least as important as the nature of the conditions. many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of remote islands. for instance in certain islands not tenanted by mammals some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds. this case presents no difficulty on my view for a hooked seed might be transported to an island by some other means and the plant then becoming slightly modified but still retaining its hooked seeds would form an endemic species having as useless an appendage as any rudimentary organfor instance as the shrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles. again islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous species now trees as alph. de candolle has shown generally have whatever the cause may be confined ranges. hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands and an herbaceous plant though it would have no chance of successfully competing in stature with a fully developed tree when established on an island and having to compete with herbaceous plants alone might readily gain an advantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants. if so natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous plants when growing on an island to whatever order they belonged and thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees. with respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands bory st. vincent long ago remarked that batrachians frogs toads newts have never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded. i have taken pains to verify this assertion and i have found it strictly true. i have however been assured that a frog exists on the mountains of the great island of new zealand but i suspect that this exception if the information be correct may be explained through glacial agency. this general absence of frogs toads and newts on so many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals for frogs have been introduced into madeira the azores and mauritius and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance. but as these animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed by seawater on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea and therefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island. but why on the theory of creation they should not have been created there it would be very difficult to explain. mammals offer another and similar case. i have carefully searched the oldest voyages but have not finished my search as yet i have not found a single instance free from doubt of a terrestrial mammal excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent or great continental island and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. the falkland islands which are inhabited by a wolflike fox come nearest to an exception but this group cannot be considered as oceanic as it lies on a bank connected with the mainland moreover icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores and they may have formerly transported foxes as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions. yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands if close to a continent and hardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied. it cannot be said on the ordinary view of creation that there has not been time for the creation of mammals many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary strata there has also been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes and on continents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals. though terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands rial mammals do occur on almost every island. new zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world norfolk island the viti archipelago the bonin islands the caroline and marianne archipelagoes and mauritius all possess their peculiar bats. why it may be asked has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? on my view this question can easily be answered for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea but bats can fly across. bats have been seen wandering by day far over the atlantic ocean and two north american species either regularly or occasionally visit bermuda at the distance of 600 miles from the mainland. i hear from mr. tomes who has specially studied this family that many of the same species have enormous ranges and are found on continents and on far distant islands. hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through natural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands with the absence of all terrestrial mammals. besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of islands from continents there is also a relation to a certain extent independent of distance between the depth of the sea separating an island from the neighbouring mainland and the presence in both of the same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified condition. mr. windsor earl has made some striking observations on this head in regard to the great malay archipelago which is traversed near celebes by a space of deep ocean and this space separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. on either side the islands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks and they are inhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds. no doubt some few anomalies occur in this great archipelago and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through mans agency but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of mr. wallace. i have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all other quarters of the world but as far as i have gone the relation generally holds good. we see britain separated by a shallow channel from europe and the mammals are the same on both sides we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similar channels from australia. the west indian islands stand on a deeply submerged bank nearly 1000 fathoms in depth and here we find american forms but the species and even the genera are distinct. as the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse of time and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated by deeper channels we can understand the frequent relation between the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continentan inexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation. all the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islandsnamely the scarcity of kindsthe richness in endemic forms in particular classes or sections of classesthe absence of whole groups as of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of rial batsthe singular proportions of certain orders of plantsherbaceous forms having been developed into trees etc.seem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means of transport having been largely efficient in the long course of time than with the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest continent for on this latter view the migration would probably have been more complete and if modification be admitted all the forms of life would have been more equally modified in accordance with the paramount importance of the relation of organism to organism. i do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival could have reached their present homes. but the probability of many islands having existed as haltingplaces of which not a wreck now remains must not be overlooked. i will here give a single instance of one of the cases of difficulty. almost all oceanic islands even the most isolated and smallest are inhabited by landshells generally by endemic species but sometimes by species found elsewhere. dr. aug. a. gould has given several interesting cases in regard to the landshells of the islands of the pacific. now it is notorious that landshells are very easily killed by salt their eggs at least such as i have tried sink in seawater and are killed by it. yet there must be on my view some unknown but highly efficient means for their transportal. would the justhatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the ground and thus get transported? it occurred to me that landshells when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of the sea. and i found that several species did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in seawater during seven days one of these shells was the helix pomatia and after it had again hybernated i put it in seawater for twenty days and it perfectly recovered. as this species has a thick calcareous operculum i removed it and when it had formed a new membranous one i immersed it for fourteen days in seawater and it recovered and crawled away but more experiments are wanted on this head. the most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland without being actually the same species. numerous instances could be given of this fact. i will give only one that of the galapagos archipelago situated under the equator between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of south america. here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of the american continent. there are twentysix land birds and twentyfive of these are ranked by mr. gould as distinct species supposed to have been created here yet the close affinity of most of these birds to american species in every character in their habits gestures and tones of voice was manifest. so it is with the other animals and with nearly all the plants as shown by dr. hooker in his admirable memoir on the flora of this archipelago. the naturalist looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the pacific distant several hundred miles from the continent yet feels that he is standing on american land. why should this be so? why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the galapagos archipelago and nowhere else bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in america? there is nothing in the conditions of life in the geological nature of the islands in their height or climate or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together which resembles closely the conditions of the south american coast in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. on the other hand there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil in climate height and size of the islands between the galapagos and cape de verde archipelagos but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! the inhabitants of the cape de verde islands are related to those of africa like those of the galapagos to america. i believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation whereas on the view here maintained it is obvious that the galapagos islands would be likely to receive colonists whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land from america and the cape de verde islands from africa and that such colonists would be liable to modificationthe principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace. many analogous facts could be given indeed it is an almost universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest continent or of other near islands. the exceptions are few and most of them can be explained. thus the plants of kerguelen land though standing nearer to africa than to america are related and that very closely as we know from dr. hookers account to those of america but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs drifted by the prevailing currents this anomaly disappears. new zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to australia the nearest mainland than to any other region and this is what might have been expected but it is also plainly related to south america which although the next nearest continent is so enormously remote that the fact becomes an anomaly. but this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both new zealand south america and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point namely from the antarctic islands when they were clothed with vegetation before the commencement of the glacial period. the affinity which though feeble i am assured by dr. hooker is real between the flora of the southwestern corner of australia and of the cape of good hope is a far more remarkable case and is at present inexplicable but this affinity is confined to the plants and will i do not doubt be some day explained. the law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago though specifically distinct to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent we sometimes see displayed on a small scale yet in a most interesting manner within the limits of the same archipelago. thus the several islands of the galapagos archipelago are tenanted as i have elsewhere shown in a quite marvellous manner by very closely related species so that the inhabitants of each separate island though mostly distinct are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world. and this is just what might have been expected on my view for the islands are situated so near each other that they would almost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source or from each other. but this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may be used as an argument against my views for it may be asked how has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each other having the same geological nature the same height climate etc. that many of the immigrants should have been differently modified though only in a small degree. this long appeared to me a great difficulty but it arises in chief part from the deeplyseated error of considering the physical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants whereas it cannot i think be disputed that the nature of the other inhabitants with which each has to compete is at least as important and generally a far more important element of success. now if we look to those inhabitants of the galapagos archipelago which are found in other parts of the world laying on one side for the moment the endemic species which cannot be here fairly included as we are considering how they have come to be modified since their arrival we find a considerable amount of difference in the several islands. this difference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means of transporta seed for instance of one plant having been brought to one island and that of another plant to another island. hence when in former times an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands or when it subsequently spread from one island to another it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions of life in the different islands for it would have to compete with different sets of organisms a plant for instance would find the bestfitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinct plants in one island than in another and it would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. if then it varied natural selection would probably favour different varieties in the different islands. some species however might spread and yet retain the same character throughout the group just as we see on continents some species spreading widely and remaining the same. the really surprising fact in this case of the galapagos archipelago and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances is that the new species formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other islands. but the islands though in sight of each other are separated by deep arms of the sea in most cases wider than the british channel and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been continuously united. the currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the archipelago and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear to be on a map. nevertheless a good many species both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago are common to the several islands and we may infer from certain facts that these have probably spread from some one island to the others. but we often take i think an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species invading each others territory when put into free intercommunication. undoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another it will in a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it but if both are equally well fitted for their own places in nature both probably will hold their own places and keep separate for almost any length of time. being familiar with the fact that many species naturalised through mans agency have spread with astonishing rapidity over new countries we are apt to infer that most species would thus spread but we should remember that the forms which become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants but are very distinct species belonging in a large proportion of cases as shown by alph. de candolle to distinct genera. in the galapagos archipelago many even of the birds though so well adapted for flying from island to island are distinct on each thus there are three closelyallied species of mockingthrush each confined to its own island. now let us suppose the mockingthrush of chatham island to be blown to charles island which has its own mockingthrush why should it succeed in establishing itself there? we may safely infer that charles island is well stocked with its own species for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be reared and we may infer that the mockingthrush peculiar to charles island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to chatham island. sir c. lyell and mr. wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject namely that madeira and the adjoining islet of porto santo possess many distinct but representative landshells some of which live in crevices of stone and although large quantities of stone are annually transported from porto santo to madeira yet this latter island has not become colonised by the porto santo species nevertheless both islands have been colonised by some european landshells which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. from these considerations i think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species which inhabit the several islands of the galapagos archipelago not having universally spread from island to island. in many other instances as in the several districts of the same continent preoccupation has probably played an important part in checking the commingling of species under the same conditions of life. thus the southeast and southwest corners of australia have nearly the same physical conditions and are united by continuous land yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals birds and plants. the principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora of oceanic islands namely that the inhabitants when not identically the same yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence colonists could most readily have been derivedthe colonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their new homesis of the widest application throughout nature. we see this on every mountain in every lake and marsh. for alpine species excepting in so far as the same forms chiefly of plants have spread widely throughout the world during the recent glacial epoch are related to those of the surrounding lowlandsthus we have in south america alpine hummingbirds alpine rodents alpine plants etc. all of strictly american forms and it is obvious that a mountain as it became slowly upheaved would naturally be colonised from the surrounding lowlands. so it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes excepting in so far as great facility of transport has given the same general forms to the whole world. we see this same principle in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of america and of europe. other analogous facts could be given. and it will i believe be universally found to be true that wherever in two regions let them be ever so distant many closely allied or representative species occur there will likewise be found some identical species showing in accordance with the foregoing view that at some former period there has been intercommunication or migration between the two regions. and wherever many closelyallied species occur there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct species and some as varieties these doubtful forms showing us the steps in the process of modification. this relation between the power and extent of migration of a species either at the present time or at some former period under different physical conditions and the existence at remote points of the world of other species allied to it is shown in another and more general way. mr. gould remarked to me long ago that in those genera of birds which range over the world many of the species have very wide ranges. i can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true though it would be difficult to prove it. amongst mammals we see it strikingly displayed in bats and in a lesser degree in the felid and canid. we see it if we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles. so it is with most freshwater productions in which so many genera range over the world and many individual species have enormous ranges. it is not meant that in worldranging genera all the species have a wide range or even that they have on an average a wide range but only that some of the species range very widely for the facility with which widelyranging species vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their average range. for instance two varieties of the same species inhabit america and europe and the species thus has an immense range but if the variation had been a little greater the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct species and the common range would have been greatly reduced. still less is it meant that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely as in the case of certain powerfullywinged birds will necessarily range widely for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers but the more important power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates. but on the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a single parent though now distributed to the most remote points of the world we ought to find and i believe as a general rule we do find that some at least of the species range very widely for it is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely undergoing modification during its diffusion and should place itself under diverse conditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring firstly into new varieties and ultimately into new species. in considering the wide distribution of certain genera we should bear in mind that some are extremely ancient and must have branched off from a common parent at a remote epoch so that in such cases there will have been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of transport and consequently for the migration of some of the species into all quarters of the world where they may have become slightly modified in relation to their new conditions. there is also some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great class generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms and consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific character. this fact together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and better fitted for distant transportation probably accounts for a law which has long been observed and which has lately been admirably discussed by alph. de candolle in regard to plants namely that the lower any group of organisms is the more widely it is apt to range. the relations just discussednamely low and slowlychanging organisms ranging more widely than the highsome of the species of widelyranging genera themselves ranging widelysuch facts as alpine lacustrine and marsh productions being related with the exceptions before specified to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands though these stations are so differentthe very close relation of the distinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelagoand especially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of the nearest mainlandare i think utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each species but are explicable on the view of colonisation from the nearest and readiest source together with the subsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes. endeavoured to show that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes of climate and of the level of the land which have certainly occurred within the recent period and of other similar changes which may have occurred within the same period if we remember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and curious means of occasional transporta subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised on if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts i think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals of the same species wherever located have descended from the same parents are not insuperable. and we are led to this conclusion which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation by some general considerations more especially from the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of subgenera genera and families. with respect to the distinct species of the same genus which on my theory must have spread from one parentsource if we make the same allowances as before for our ignorance and remember that some forms of life change most slowly enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration i do not think that the difficulties are insuperable though they often are in this case and in that of the individuals of the same species extremely grave. as exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution i have attempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern glacial period which i am fully convinced simultaneously affected the whole world or at least great meridional belts. as showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport i have discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of freshwater productions.  if the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course of time the individuals of the same species and likewise of allied species have proceeded from some one source then i think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration generally of the more dominant forms of life together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. we can thus understand the high importance of barriers whether of land or water which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. we can thus understand the localisation of subgenera genera and families and how it is that under different latitudes for instance in south america the inhabitants of the plains and mountains of the forests marshes and deserts are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent. bearing in mind that the mutual relations of organism to organism are of the highest importance we can see why two areas having nearly the same physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms of life for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new inhabitants entered one region according to the nature of the communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter either in greater or lesser numbers according or not as those which entered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and with the aborigines and according as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less rapidly there would ensue in different regions independently of their physical conditions infinitely diversified conditions of lifethere would be an almost endless amount of organic action and reactionand we should find as we do find some groups of beings greatly and some only slightly modifiedsome developed in great force some existing in scanty numbersin the different great geographical provinces of the world. on these same principles we can understand as i have endeavoured to show why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar and why in relation to the means of migration one group of beings even within the same class should have all its species endemic and another group should have all its species common to other quarters of the world. we can see why whole groups of organisms as batrachians and terrestrial mammals should be absent from oceanic islands whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar species of rial mammals or bats. we can see why there should be some relation between the presence of mammals in a more or less modified condition and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland. we can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago though specifically distinct on the several islets should be closely related to each other and likewise be related but less closely to those of the nearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived. we can see why in two areas however distant from each other there should be a correlation in the presence of identical species of varieties of doubtful species and of distinct but representative species. as the late edward forbes often insisted there is a striking parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space the laws governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those governing at the present time the differences in different areas. we see this in many facts. the endurance of each species and group of species is continuous in time for the exceptions to the rule are so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent but which occur above and below so in space it certainly is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species or by a group of species is continuous and the exceptions which are not rare may as i have attempted to show be accounted for by migration at some former period under different conditions or by occasional means of transport and by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. both in time and space species and groups of species have their points of maximum development. groups of species belonging either to a certain period of time or to a certain area are often characterised by trifling characters in common as of sculpture or colour. in looking to the long succession of ages as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world we find that some organisms differ little whilst others belonging to a different class or to a different order or even only to a different family of the same order differ greatly. in both time and space the lower members of each class generally change less than the higher but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule. on my theory these several relations throughout time and space are intelligible for whether we look to the forms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same quarter of the world or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters in both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the same bond of ordinary generation and the more nearly any two forms are related in blood the nearer they will generally stand to each other in time and space in both cases the laws of variation have been the same and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of natural selection.   mutual affinities of organic beings morphology embryology

origin explained. summary.  from the first dawn of life all organic beings are found to resemble each other in descending degrees so that they can be classed in groups under groups. this classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations. the existence of groups would have been of simple signification if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land and another the water one to feed on flesh another on vegetable matter and so on but the case is widely different in nature for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have different habits. in our second and fourth show that it is the widely ranging the much diffused and common that is the dominant species belonging to the larger genera which vary most. the varieties or incipient species thus produced ultimately become converted as i believe into new and distinct species and these on the principle of inheritance tend to produce other new and dominant species. consequently the groups which are now large and which generally include many dominant species tend to go on increasing indefinitely in size. i further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature there is a constant tendency in their characters to diverge. this conclusion was supported by looking at the great diversity of the forms of life which in any small area come into the closest competition and by looking to certain facts in naturalisation. i attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character to supplant and exterminate the less divergent the less improved and preceding forms. i request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action as formerly explained of these several principles and he will see that the inevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. in the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species and all the genera on this line form together one class for all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent and consequently have inherited something in common. but the three genera on the left hand have on this same principle much in common and form a subfamily distinct from that including the next two genera on the right hand which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent. these five genera have also much though less in common and they form a family distinct from that including the three genera still further to the right hand which diverged at a still earlier period. and all these genera descended from a form an order distinct from the genera descended from i. so that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera and the genera are included in or subordinate to subfamilies families and orders all united into one class. thus the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group which from its familiarity does not always sufficiently strike us is in my judgment fully explained. naturalists try to arrange the species genera and families in each class on what is called the natural system. but what is meant by this system? some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike and for separating those which are most unlike or as an artificial means for enunciating as briefly as possible general propositionsthat is by one sentence to give the characters common for instance to all mammals by another those common to all carnivora by another those common to the doggenus and then by adding a single sentence a full description is given of each kind of dog. the ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable. but many naturalists think that something more is meant by the natural system they believe that it reveals the plan of the creator but unless it be specified whether order in time or space or what else is meant by the plan of the creator it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. such expressions as that famous one of linnus and which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form that the characters do not make the genus but that the genus gives the characters seem to imply that something more is included in our classification than mere resemblance. i believe that something more is included and that propinquity of descentthe only known cause of the similarity of organic beingsis the bond hidden as it is by various degrees of modification which is partially revealed to us by our classifications. let us now consider the rules followed in classification and the difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either gives some unknown plan of creation or is simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most like each other. it might have been thought and was in ancient times thought that those parts of the structure which determined the habits of life and the general place of each being in the economy of nature would be of very high importance in classification. nothing can be more false. no one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew of a dugong to a whale of a whale to a fish as of any importance. these resemblances though so intimately connected with the whole life of the being are ranked as merely adaptive or analogical characters but to the consideration of these resemblances we shall have to recur. it may even be given as a general rule that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special habits the more important it becomes for classification. as an instance owen in speaking of the dugong says the generative organs being those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal i have always regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities. we are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential character. so with plants how remarkable it is that the organs of vegetation on which their whole life depends are of little signification excepting in the first main divisions whereas the organs of reproduction with their product the seed are of paramount importance! we must not therefore in classifying trust to resemblances in parts of the organisation however important they may be for the welfare of the being in relation to the outer world. perhaps from this cause it has partly arisen that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on resemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance. no doubt this view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is generally but by no means always true. but their importance for classification i believe depends on their greater constancy throughout large groups of species and this constancy depends on such organs having generally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to their conditions of life. that the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its classificatory value is almost shown by the one fact that in allied groups in which the same organ as we have every reason to suppose has nearly the same physiological value its classificatory value is widely different. no naturalist can have worked at any group without being struck with this fact and it has been most fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author. it will suffice to quote the highest authority robert brown who in speaking of certain organs in the proteace says their generic importance like that of all their parts not only in this but as i apprehend in every natural family is very unequal and in some cases seems to be entirely lost. again in another work he says the genera of the connarace differ in having one or more ovaria in the existence or absence of albumen in the imbricate or valvular stivation. any one of these characters singly is frequently of more than generic importance though here even when all taken together they appear insufficient to separate cnestis from connarus. to give an example amongst insects in one great division of the hymenoptera the antenn as westwood has remarked are most constant in structure in another division they differ much and the differences are of quite subordinate value in classification yet no one probably will say that the antenn in these two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological importance. any number of instances could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same important organ within the same group of beings. again no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high physiological or vital importance yet undoubtedly organs in this condition are often of high value in classification. no one will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants and certain rudimentary bones of the leg are highly serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between ruminants and pachyderms. robert brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the highest importance in the classification of the grasses. numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole groups. for instance whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth the only character according to owen which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptilesthe inflection of the angle of the jaws in marsupialsthe manner in which the wings of insects are foldedmere colour in certain algmere pubescence on parts of the flower in grassesthe nature of the dermal covering as hair or feathers in the vertebrata. if the ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair this external and trifling character would i think have been considered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds and reptiles as an approach in structure in any one internal and important organ. the importance for classification of trifling characters mainly depends on their being correlated with several other characters of more or less importance. the value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident in natural history. hence as has often been remarked a species may depart from its allies in several characters both of high physiological importance and of almost universal prevalence and yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. hence also it has been found that a classification founded on any single character however important that may be has always failed for no part of the organisation is universally constant. the importance of an aggregate of characters even when none are important alone explains i think that saying of linnus that the characters do not give the genus but the genus gives the characters for this saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance too slight to be defined. certain plants belonging to the malpighiace bear perfect and degraded flowers in the latter as a. de jussieu has remarked the greater number of the characters proper to the species to the genus to the family to the class disappear and thus laugh at our classification. but when aspicarpa produced in france during several years only degraded flowers departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order yet m. richard sagaciously saw as jussieu observes that this genus should still be retained amongst the malpighiace. this case seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes necessarily founded. practically when naturalists are at work they do not trouble themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use in defining a group or in allocating any particular species. if they find a character nearly uniform and common to a great number of forms and not common to others they use it as one of high value if common to some lesser number they use it as of subordinate value. this principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist aug. st. hilaire. if certain characters are always found correlated with others though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them especial value is set on them. as in most groups of animals important organs such as those for propelling the blood or for rating it or those for propagating the race are found nearly uniform they are considered as highly serviceable in classification but in some groups of animals all these the most important vital organs are found to offer characters of quite subordinate value. we can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult for our classifications of course include all ages of each species. but it is by no means obvious on the ordinary view why the structure of the embryo should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature. yet it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists milne edwards and agassiz that embryonic characters are the most important of any in the classification of animals and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true. the same fact holds good with flowering plants of which the two main divisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryoon the number and position of the embryonic leaves or cotyledons and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. in our discussion on embryology we shall see why such characters are so valuable on the view of classification tacitly including the idea of descent. our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities. nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all birds but in the case of crustaceans such definition has hitherto been found impossible. there are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series which have hardly a character in common yet the species at both ends from being plainly allied to others and these to others and so onwards can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this and to no other class of the articulata. geographical distribution has often been used though perhaps not quite logically in classification more especially in very large groups of closely allied forms. temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of this practice in certain groups of birds and it has been followed by several entomologists and botanists. finally with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of species such as orders suborders families subfamilies and genera they seem to be at least at present almost arbitrary. several of the best botanists such as mr. bentham and others have strongly insisted on their arbitrary value. instances could be given amongst plants and insects of a group of forms first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus and then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family and this has been done not because further research has detected important structural differences at first overlooked but because numerous allied species with slightly different grades of difference have been subsequently discovered.  all the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained if i do not greatly deceive myself on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species are those which have been inherited from a common parent and in so far all true classification is genealogical that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking and not some unknown plan of creation or the enunciation of general propositions and the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike. but i must explain my meaning more fully. i believe that the arrangement of the groups within each class in due subordination and relation to the other groups must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor may differ greatly being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera families sections or orders. the reader will best understand what is meant if he will take suppose the letters a to l to represent allied genera which lived during the silurian epoch and these have descended from a species which existed at an unknown anterior period. species of three of these genera a f and i have transmitted modified descendants to the present day represented by the fifteen genera a14 to z14 on the uppermost horizontal line. now all these modified descendants from a single species are represented as related in blood or descent to the same degree they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each other. the forms descended from a now broken up into two or three families constitute a distinct order from those descended from i also broken up into two families. nor can the existing species descended from a be ranked in the same genus with the parent a or those from i with the parent i. but the existing genus f14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified and it will then rank with the parentgenus f just as some few still living organic beings belong to silurian genera. so that the amount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to each other in the same degree in blood has come to be widely different. nevertheless their genealogical arrangement remains strictly true not only at the present time but at each successive period of descent. all the modified descendants from a will have inherited something in common from their common parent as will all the descendants from i so will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants at each successive period. if however we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of a or of i have been so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of their parentage in this case their places in a natural classification will have been more or less completely lostas sometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms. all the descendants of the genus f along its whole line of descent are supposed to have been but little modified and they yet form a single genus. but this genus though much isolated will still occupy its proper intermediate position for f originally was intermediate in character between a and i and the several genera descended from these two genera will have inherited to a certain extent their characters. this natural arrangement is shown as far as is possible on paper in the diagram but in much too simple a manner. if a branching diagram had not been used and only the names of the groups had been written in a linear series it would have been still less possible to have given a natural arrangement and it is notoriously not possible to represent in a series on a flat surface the affinities which we discover in nature amongst the beings of the same group. thus on the view which i hold the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement like a pedigree but the degrees of modification which the different groups have undergone have to be expressed by ranking them under different socalled genera subfamilies families sections orders and classes. it may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification by taking the case of languages. if we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world and if all extinct languages and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects had to be included such an arrangement would i think be the only possible one. yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little and had given rise to few new languages whilst others owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races descended from a common race had altered much and had given rise to many new languages and dialects. the various degrees of difference in the languages from the same stock would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be genealogical and this would be strictly natural as it would connect together all languages extinct and modern by the closest affinities and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue. in confirmation of this view let us glance at the classification of varieties which are believed or known to have descended from one species. these are grouped under species with subvarieties under varieties and with our domestic productions several other grades of difference are requisite as we have seen with pigeons. the origin of the existence of groups subordinate to groups is the same with varieties as with species namely closeness of descent with various degrees of modification. nearly the same rules are followed in classifying varieties as with species. authors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system we are cautioned for instance not to class two varieties of the pineapple together merely because their fruit though the most important part happens to be nearly identical no one puts the swedish and common turnips together though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar. whatever part is found to be most constant is used in classing varieties thus the great agriculturist marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body etc. whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable because less constant. in classing varieties i apprehend if we had a real pedigree a genealogical classification would be universally preferred and it has been attempted by some authors. for we might feel sure whether there had been more or less modification the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. in tumbler pigeons though some subvarieties differ from the others in the important character of having a longer beak yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling but the shortfaced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit nevertheless without any reasoning or thinking on the subject these tumblers are kept in the same group because allied in blood and alike in some other respects. if it could be proved that the hottentot had descended from the negro i think he would be classed under the negro group however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes. with species in a state of nature every naturalist has in fact brought descent into his classification for he includes in his lowest grade or that of a species the two sexes and how enormously these sometimes differ in the most important characters is known to every naturalist scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes when adult and yet no one dreams of separating them. the naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the same individual however much they may differ from each other and from the adult as he likewise includes the socalled alternate generations of steenstrup which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same individual. he includes monsters he includes varieties not solely because they closely resemble the parentform but because they are descended from it. he who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose or conversely ranks them together as a single species and gives a single definition. as soon as three orchidean forms monochanthus myanthus and catasetum which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera were known to be sometimes produced on the same spike they were immediately included as a single species. but it may be asked what ought we to do if it could be proved that one species of kangaroo had been produced by a long course of modification from a bear? ought we to rank this one species with bears and what should we do with the other species? the supposition is of course preposterous and i might answer by the argumentum ad hominem and ask what should be done if a perfect kangaroo were seen to come out of the womb of a bear? according to all analogy it would be ranked with bears but then assuredly all the other species of the kangaroo family would have to be classed under the bear genus. the whole case is preposterous for where there has been close descent in common there will certainly be close resemblance or affinity. as descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals of the same species though the males and females and larv are sometimes extremely different and as it has been used in classing varieties which have undergone a certain and sometimes a considerable amount of modification may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera and genera under higher groups though in these cases the modification has been greater in degree and has taken a longer time to complete? i believe it has thus been unconsciously used and only thus can i understand the several rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists. we have no written pedigrees we have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind. therefore we choose those characters which as far as we can judge are the least likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed. rudimentary structures on this view are as good as or even sometimes better than other parts of the organisation. we care not how trifling a character may belet it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw the manner in which an insects wing is folded whether the skin be covered by hair or feathersif it prevail throughout many and different species especially those having very different habits of life it assumes high value for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits only by its inheritance from a common parent. we may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure but when several characters let them be ever so trifling occur together throughout a large group of beings having different habits we may feel almost sure on the theory of descent that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor. and we know that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in classification. we can understand why a species or a group of species may depart in several of its most important characteristics from its allies and yet be safely classed with them. this may be safely done and is often done as long as a sufficient number of characters let them be ever so unimportant betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. let two forms have not a single character in common yet if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups we may at once infer their community of descent and we put them all into the same class. as we find organs of high physiological importancethose which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of existenceare generally the most constant we attach especial value to them but if these same organs in another group or section of a group are found to differ much we at once value them less in our classification. we shall hereafter i think clearly see why embryological characters are of such high classificatory importance. geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large and widelydistributed genera because all the species of the same genus inhabiting any distinct and isolated region have in all probability descended from the same parents. we can understand on these views the very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. lamarck first called attention to this distinction and he has been ably followed by macleay and others. the resemblance in the shape of the body and in the finlike anterior limbs between the dugong which is a pachydermatous animal and the whale and between both these mammals and fishes is analogical. amongst insects there are innumerable instances thus linnus misled by external appearances actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth. we see something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip. the resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct animals. on my view of characters being of real importance for classification only in so far as they reveal descent we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being are almost valueless to the systematist. for animals belonging to two most distinct lines of descent may readily become adapted to similar conditions and thus assume a close external resemblance but such resemblances will not revealwill rather tend to conceal their bloodrelationship to their proper lines of descent. we can also understand the apparent paradox that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another thus the shape of the body and finlike limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water but the shape of the body and finlike limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale family for these cetaceans agree in so many characters great and small that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor. so it is with fishes. as members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstancesto inhabit for instance the three elements of land air and waterwe can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the subgroups in distinct classes. a naturalist struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes and all our experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range and thus the septenary quinary quaternary and ternary classifications have probably arisen. as the modified descendants of dominant species belonging to the larger genera tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant they are almost sure to spread widely and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature. the larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size and they consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups. thus we can account for the fact that all organisms recent and extinct are included under a few great orders under still fewer classes and all in one great natural system. as showing how few the higher groups are in number and how widely spread they are throughout the world the fact is striking that the discovery of australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order and that in the vegetable kingdom as i learn from dr. hooker it has added only two or three orders of small size. principle of each group having generally diverged much in character during the longcontinued process of modification how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate between existing groups. a few old and intermediate parentforms having occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified will give to us our socalled osculant or aberrant groups. the more aberrant any form is the greater must be the number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost. and we have some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from extinction for they are generally represented by extremely few species and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other which again implies extinction. the genera ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren for example would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by a single one but such richness in species as i find after some investigation does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera. we can i think account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors with a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable circumstances. mr. waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group this affinity in most cases is general and not special thus according to mr. waterhouse of all rodents the bizcacha is most nearly related to marsupials but in the points in which it approaches this order its relations are general and not to any one marsupial species more than to another. as the points of affinity of the bizcacha to marsupials are believed to be real and not merely adaptive they are due on my theory to inheritance in common. therefore we must suppose either that all rodents including the bizcacha branched off from some very ancient marsupial which will have had a character in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing marsupials or that both rodents and marsupials branched off from a common progenitor and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions. on either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained by inheritance more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have other rodents and therefore it will not be specially related to any one existing marsupial but indirectly to all or nearly all marsupials from having partially retained the character of their common progenitor or of an early member of the group. on the other hand of all marsupials as mr. waterhouse has remarked the phascolomys resembles most nearly not any one species but the general order of rodents. in this case however it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only analogical owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a rodent. the elder de candolle has made nearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders of plants. on the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character of the species descended from a common parent together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common we can understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group are connected together. for the common parent of a whole family of species now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and subgroups will have transmitted some of its characters modified in various ways and degrees to all and the several species will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths as may be seen in the diagram so often referred to mounting up through many predecessors. as it is difficult to show the bloodrelationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family even by the aid of a genealogical tree and almost impossible to do this without this aid we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing without the aid of a diagram the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same great natural class. important part in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in each class. we may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes from each otherfor instance of birds from all other vertebrate animalsby the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly lost through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes. there has been less entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with batrachians. there has been still less in some other classes as in that of the crustacea for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long but broken chain of affinities. extinction has only separated groups it has by no means made them for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear though it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished from other groups as all would blend together by steps as fine as those between the finest existing varieties nevertheless a natural classification or at least a natural arrangement would be possible. we shall see this by turning to the diagram the letters a to l may represent eleven silurian genera some of which have produced large groups of modified descendants. every intermediate link between these eleven genera and their primordial parent and every intermediate link in each branch and subbranch of their descendants may be supposed to be still alive and the links to be as fine as those between the finest varieties. in this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition by which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished from their more immediate parents or these parents from their ancient and unknown progenitor. yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and on the principle of inheritance all the forms descended from a or from i would have something in common. in a tree we can specify this or that branch though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together. we could not as i have said define the several groups but we could pick out types or forms representing most of the characters of each group whether large or small and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences between them. this is what we should be driven to if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have lived throughout all time and space. we shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect a collection nevertheless in certain classes we are tending in this direction and milne edwards has lately insisted in an able paper on the high importance of looking to types whether or not we can separate and define the groups to which such types belong. finally we have seen that natural selection which results from the struggle for existence and which almost inevitably induces extinction and divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant parentspecies explains that great and universal feature in the affinities of all organic beings namely their subordination in group under group. we use the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of all ages although having few characters in common under one species we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties however different they may be from their parent and i believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the natural system. on this idea of the natural system being in so far as it has been perfected genealogical in its arrangement with the grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent expressed by the terms genera families orders etc. we can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our classification. we can understand why we value certain resemblances far more than others why we are permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs or others of trifling physiological importance why in comparing one group with a distinct group we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters and yet use these same characters within the limits of the same group. we can clearly see how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in one great system and how the several members of each class are connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities. we shall never probably disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the members of any one class but when we have a distinct object in view and do not look to some unknown plan of creation we may hope to make sure but slow progress. morphology.we have seen that the members of the same class independently of their habits of life resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation. this resemblance is often expressed by the term unity of type or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous. the whole subject is included under the general name of morphology. this is the most interesting department of natural history and may be said to be its very soul. what can be more curious than that the hand of a man formed for grasping that of a mole for digging the leg of the horse the paddle of the porpoise and the wing of the bat should all be constructed on the same pattern and should include the same bones in the same relative positions? geoffroy st. hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relative connexion in homologous organs the parts may change to almost any extent in form and size and yet they always remain connected together in the same order. we never find for instance the bones of the arm and forearm or of the thigh and leg transposed. hence the same names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals. we see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinxmoth the curious folded one of a bee or bug and the great jaws of a beetle?yet all these organs serving for such different purposes are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip mandibles and two pairs of maxill. analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. so it is with the flowers of plants. nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of pattern in members of the same class by utility or by the doctrine of final causes. the hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted by owen in his most interesting work on the nature of limbs. on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being we can only say that so it isthat it has so pleased the creator to construct each animal and plant. the explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modificationseach modification being profitable in some way to the modified form but often affecting by correlation of growth other parts of the organisation. in changes of this nature there will be little or no tendency to modify the original pattern or to transpose parts. the bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane so as to serve as a fin or a webbed foot might have all its bones or certain bones lengthened to any extent and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent so as to serve as a wing yet in all this great amount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of the several parts. if we suppose that the ancient progenitor the archetype as it may be called of all mammals had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern for whatever purpose they served we can at once perceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the whole class. so with the mouths of insects we have only to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip mandibles and two pair of maxill these parts being perhaps very simple in form and then natural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths of insects. nevertheless it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts by the soldering together of other parts and by the doubling or multiplication of othersvariations which we know to be within the limits of possibility. in the paddles of the extinct gigantic sealizards and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans the general pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured. there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject namely the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous withthat is correspond in number and in relative connexion withthe elemental parts of a certain number of vertebr. the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. we see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. it is familiar to almost every one that in a flower the relative position of the sepals petals stamens and pistils as well as their intimate structure are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves arranged in a spire. in monstrous plants we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals and in flowers that organs which when mature become extremely different are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? as owen has remarked the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat used as they are for such totally different purposes? why should one crustacean which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts consequently always have fewer legs or conversely those with many legs have simpler mouths? why should the sepals petals stamens and pistils in any individual flower though fitted for such widely different purposes be all constructed on the same pattern? on the theory of natural selection we can satisfactorily answer these questions. in the vertebrata we see a series of internal vertebr bearing certain processes and appendages in the articulata we see the body divided into a series of segments bearing external appendages and in flowering plants we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves. an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic as owen has observed of all low or littlemodified forms therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebr the unknown progenitor of the articulata many segments and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants many spiral whorls of leaves. we have formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure consequently it is quite probable that natural selection during a longcontinued course of modification should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar elements many times repeated and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes. and as the whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight successive steps we need not wonder at discovering in such parts or organs a certain degree of fundamental resemblance retained by the strong principle of inheritance. in the great class of molluscs though we can homologise the parts of one species with those of another and distinct species we can indicate but few serial homologies that is we are seldom enabled to say that one part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual. and we can understand this fact for in molluscs even in the lowest members of the class we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed vertebr the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs the stamens and pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves but it would in these cases probably be more correct as professor huxley has remarked to speak of both skull and vertebr both jaws and legs etc.as having been metamorphosed not one from the other but from some common element. naturalists however use such language only in a metaphorical sense they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent primordial organs of any kindvertebr in the one case and legs in the otherhave actually been modified into skulls or jaws. yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification. on my view these terms may be used literally and the wonderful fact of the jaws for instance of a crab retaining numerous characters which they would probably have retained through inheritance if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent from true legs or from some simple appendage is explained. embryology.it has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the individual which when mature become widely different and serve for different purposes are in the embryo exactly alike. the embryos also of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar a better proof of this cannot be given than a circumstance mentioned by agassiz namely that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some vertebrate animal he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal bird or reptile. the vermiform larv of moths flies beetles etc. resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects but in the case of larv the embryos are active and have been adapted for special lines of life. a trace of the law of embryonic resemblance sometimes lasts till a rather late age thus birds of the same genus and of closely allied genera often resemble each other in their first and second plumage as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush group. in the cat tribe most of the species are striped or spotted in lines and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion. we occasionally though rarely see something of this kind in plants thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminos. the points of structure in which the embryos of widely different animals of the same class resemble each other often have no direct relation to their conditions of existence. we cannot for instance suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar looplike course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar conditionsin the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest and in the spawn of a frog under water. we have no more reason to believe in such a relation than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand of a man wing of a bat and fin of a porpoise are related to similar conditions of life. no one will suppose that the stripes on the whelp of a lion or the spots on the young blackbird are of any use to these animals or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed. the case however is different when an animal during any part of its embryonic career is active and has to provide for itself. the period of activity may come on earlier or later in life but whenever it comes on the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. from such special adaptations the similarity of the larv or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes much obscured and cases could be given of the larv of two species or of two groups of species differing quite as much or even more from each other than do their adult parents. in most cases however the larv though active still obey more or less closely the law of common embryonic resemblance. cirripedes afford a good instance of this even the illustrious cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was as it certainly is a crustacean but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner. so again the two main divisions of cirripedes the pedunculated and sessile which differ widely in external appearance have larv in all their several stages barely distinguishable.  the embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation i use this expression though i am aware that it is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower. but no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. in some cases however the mature animal is generally considered as lower in the scale than the larva as with certain parasitic crustaceans. to refer once again to cirripedes the larv in the first stage have three pairs of legs a very simple single eye and a probosciformed mouth with which they feed largely for they increase much in size. in the second stage answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs a pair of magnificent compound eyes and extremely complex antenn but they have a closed and imperfect mouth and cannot feed their function at this stage is to search by their welldeveloped organs of sense and to reach by their active powers of swimming a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final metamorphosis. when this is completed they are fixed for life their legs are now converted into prehensile organs they again obtain a wellconstructed mouth but they have no antenn and their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute single and very simple eyespot. in this last and complete state cirripedes may be considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition. but in some genera the larv become developed either into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure or into what i have called complemental males and in the latter the development has assuredly been retrograde for the male is a mere sack which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth stomach or other organ of importance excepting for reproduction.  we are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the embryo and the adult and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of widely different animals within the same class that we might be led to look at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth. but there is no obvious reason why for instance the wing of a bat or the fin of a porpoise should not have been sketched out with all the parts in proper proportion as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo. and in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the adult thus owen has remarked in regard to cuttlefish there is no metamorphosis the cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed and again in spiders there is nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis. the larv of insects whether adapted to the most diverse and active habits or quite inactive being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of proper nutriment yet nearly all pass through a similar wormlike stage of development but in some few cases as in that of aphis if we look to the admirable drawings by professor huxley of the development of this insect we see no trace of the vermiform stage. how then can we explain these several facts in embryologynamely the very general but not universal difference in structure between the embryo and the adultof parts in the same individual embryo which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes being at this early period of growth alikeof embryos of different species within the same class generally but not universally resembling each otherof the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for itselfof the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal into which it is developed. i believe that all these facts can be explained as follows on the view of descent with modification. it is commonly assumed perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the embryo at a very early period that slight variations necessarily appear at an equally early period. but we have little evidence on this headindeed the evidence rather points the other way for it is notorious that breeders of cattle horses and various fancy animals cannot positively tell until some time after the animal has been born what its merits or form will ultimately turn out. we see this plainly in our own children we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short or what its precise features will be. the question is not at what period of life any variation has been caused but at what period it is fully displayed. the cause may have acted and i believe generally has acted even before the embryo is formed and the variation may be due to the male and female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which either parent or their ancestors have been exposed. nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period even before the formation of the embryo may appear late in life as when an hereditary disease which appears in old age alone has been communicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of one parent. or again as when the horns of crossbred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either parent. for the welfare of a very young animal as long as it remains in its mothers womb or in the egg or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent it must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life. it would not signify for instance to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length as long as it was fed by its parents. hence i conclude that it is quite possible that each of the many successive modifications by which each species has acquired its present structure may have supervened at a not very early period of life and some direct evidence from our domestic animals supports this view. but in other cases it is quite possible that each successive modification or most of them may have appeared at an extremely early period. render it probable that at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring. certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages for instance peculiarities in the caterpillar cocoon or imago states of the silkmoth or again in the horns of almost fullgrown cattle. but further than this variations which for all that we can see might have appeared earlier or later in life tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent. i am far from meaning that this is invariably the case and i could give a good many cases of variations taking the word in the largest sense which have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent. these two principles if their truth be admitted will i believe explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology. but first let us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. some authors who have written on dogs maintain that the greyhound and bulldog though appearing so different are really varieties most closely allied and have probably descended from the same wild stock hence i was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other i was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents and this judging by the eye seemed almost to be the case but on actually measuring the old dogs and their sixdays old puppies i found that the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional difference. so again i was told that the foals of cart and racehorses differed as much as the fullgrown animals and this surprised me greatly as i think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a threedays old colt of a race and heavy carthorse i find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference. as the evidence appears to me conclusive that the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from one wild species i compared young pigeons of various breeds within twelve hours after being hatched i carefully measured the proportions but will not here give details of the beak width of mouth length of nostril and of eyelid size of feet and length of leg in the wild stock in pouters fantails runts barbs dragons carriers and tumblers. now some of these birds when mature differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak that they would i cannot doubt be ranked in distinct genera had they been natural productions. but when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row though most of them could be distinguished from each other yet their proportional differences in the above specified several points were incomparably less than in the fullgrown birds. some characteristic points of differencefor instance that of the width of mouthcould hardly be detected in the young. but there was one remarkable exception to this rule for the young of the shortfaced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rockpigeon and of the other breeds in all its proportions almost exactly as much as in the adult state. the two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties. fanciers select their horses dogs and pigeons for breeding when they are nearly grown up they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have been acquired earlier or later in life if the fullgrown animal possesses them. and the cases just given more especially that of pigeons seem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each breed and which have been accumulated by mans selection have not generally first appeared at an early period of life and have been inherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period. but the case of the shortfaced tumbler which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions proves that this is not the universal rule for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual or if not so the differences must have been inherited not at the corresponding but at an earlier age. now let us apply these facts and the above two principleswhich latter though not proved true can be shown to be in some degree probableto species in a state of nature. let us take a genus of birds descended on my theory from some one parentspecies and of which the several new species have become modified through natural selection in accordance with their diverse habits. then from the many slight successive steps of variation having supervened at a rather late age and having been inherited at a corresponding age the young of the new species of our supposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the adults just as we have seen in the case of pigeons. we may extend this view to whole families or even classes. the forelimbs for instance which served as legs in the parentspecies may become by a long course of modification adapted in one descendant to act as hands in another as paddles in another as wings and on the above two principlesnamely of each successive modification supervening at a rather late age and being inherited at a corresponding late agethe forelimbs in the embryos of the several descendants of the parentspecies will still resemble each other closely for they will not have been modified. but in each individual new species the embryonic forelimbs will differ greatly from the forelimbs in the mature animal the limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a rather late period of life and having thus been converted into hands or paddles or wings. whatever influence longcontinued exercise or use on the one hand and disuse on the other may have in modifying an organ such influence will mainly affect the mature animal which has come to its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age. whereas the young will remain unmodified or be modified in a lesser degree by the effects of use and disuse. in certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene from causes of which we are wholly ignorant at a very early period of life or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it first appeared. in either case as with the shortfaced tumbler the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parentform. we have seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals as with cuttlefish and spiders and with a few members of the great class of insects as with aphis. with respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies firstly from the young during a course of modification carried on for many generations having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage of development and secondly from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents for in this case it would be indispensable for the existence of the species that the child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with its parents in accordance with their similar habits. some further explanation however of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite. if on the other hand it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree different from those of their parent and consequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner then on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages the active young or larv might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their parents. such differences might also become correlated with successive stages of development so that the larv in the first stage might differ greatly from the larv in the second stage as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes. the adult might become fitted for sites or habits in which organs of locomotion or of the senses etc. would be useless and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde. as all the organic beings extinct and recent which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together and as all have been connected by the finest gradations the best or indeed if our collections were nearly perfect the only possible arrangement would be genealogical. descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system. on this view we can understand how it is that in the eyes of most naturalists the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult. for the embryo is the animal in its less modified state and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor. in two groups of animal however much they may at present differ from each other in structure and habits if they pass through the same or similar embryonic stages we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or nearly similar parents and are therefore in that degree closely related. thus community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent. it will reveal this community of descent however much the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured we have seen for instance that cirripedes can at once be recognised by their larv as belonging to the great class of crustaceans. as the embryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified ancient progenitors we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their descendantsour existing species. agassiz believes this to be a law of nature but i am bound to confess that i only hope to see the law hereafter proved true. it can be proved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state now supposed to be represented in many embryos has not been obliterated either by the successive variations in a long course of modification having supervened at a very early age or by the variations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at which they first appeared. it should also be borne in mind that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of recent forms may be true but yet owing to the geological record not extending far enough back in time may remain for a long period or for ever incapable of demonstration. thus as it seems to me the leading facts in embryology which are second in importance to none in natural history are explained on the principle of slight modifications not appearing in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor at a very early period in the life of each though perhaps caused at the earliest and being inherited at a corresponding not early period. embryology rises greatly in interest when we thus look at the embryo as a picture more or less obscured of the common parentform of each great class of animals. rudimentary atrophied or aborted organs.organs or parts in this strange condition bearing the stamp of inutility are extremely common throughout nature. for instance rudimentary mamm are very general in the males of mammals i presume that the bastardwing in birds may be safely considered as a digit in a rudimentary state in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is rudimentary in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hind limbs. some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious for instance the presence of teeth in foetal whales which when grown up have not a tooth in their heads and the presence of teeth which never cut through the gums in the upper jaws of our unborn calves. it has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds. nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight yet in how many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight and not rarely lying under wingcases firmly soldered together! the meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable for instance there are beetles of the same genus and even of the same species resembling each other most closely in all respects one of which will have fullsized wings and another mere rudiments of membrane and here it is impossible to doubt that the rudiments represent wings. rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality and are merely not developed this seems to be the case with the mamm of male mammals for many instances are on record of these organs having become well developed in fullgrown males and having secreted milk. so again there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus bos but in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk. in individual plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments and sometimes in a welldeveloped state. in plants with separated sexes the male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil and klreuter found that by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species the rudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size and this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in nature. an organ serving for two purposes may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one even the more important purpose and remain perfectly efficient for the other. thus in plants the office of the pistil is to allow the pollentubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its base. the pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style but in some composit the male florets which of course cannot be fecundated have a pistil which is in a rudimentary state for it is not crowned with a stigma but the style remains well developed and is clothed with hairs as in other composit for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the surrounding anthers. again an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose and be used for a distinct object in certain fish the swimbladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung. other similar instances could be given. rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable to vary in degree of development and in other respects. moreover in closely allied species the degree to which the same organ has been rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much. this latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain groups. rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted and this implies that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ which analogy would lead us to expect to find and which is occasionally found in monstrous individuals of the species. thus in the snapdragon antirrhinum we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen but this may sometimes be seen. in tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of a class nothing is more common or more necessary than the use and discovery of rudiments. this is well shown in the drawings given by owen of the bones of the leg of the horse ox and rhinoceros. it is an important fact that rudimentary organs such as teeth in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants can often be detected in the embryo but afterwards wholly disappear. it is also i believe a universal rule that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining parts in the embryo than in the adult so that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary or even cannot be said to be in any degree rudimentary. hence also a rudimentary organ in the adult is often said to have retained its embryonic condition. i have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs. in reflecting on them every one must be struck with astonishment for the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless. in works on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created for the sake of symmetry or in order to complete the scheme of nature but this seems to me no explanation merely a restatement of the fact. would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun satellites follow the same course round the planets for the sake of symmetry and to complete the scheme of nature? an eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs by supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess or injurious to the system but can we suppose that the minute papilla which often represents the pistil in male flowers and which is formed merely of cellular tissue can thus act? can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are subsequently absorbed can be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime? when a mans fingers have been amputated imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps i could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have appeared not from unknown laws of growth but in order to excrete horny matter as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose. on my view of descent with modification the origin of rudimentary organs is simple. we have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic productionsas the stump of a tail in tailless breedsthe vestige of an ear in earless breedsthe reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle more especially according to youatt in young animalsand the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. we often see rudiments of various parts in monsters. but i doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature further than by showing that rudiments can be produced for i doubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes. i believe that disuse has been the main agency that it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction of various organs until they have become rudimentaryas in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands which have seldom been forced to take flight and have ultimately lost the power of flying. again an organ useful under certain conditions might become injurious under others as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands and in this case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary. any change in function which can be effected by insensibly small steps is within the power of natural selection so that an organ rendered during changed habits of life useless or injurious for one purpose might easily be modified and used for another purpose. or an organ might be retained for one alone of its former functions. an organ when rendered useless may well be variable for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection. at whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its full powers of action the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age and consequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo. thus we can understand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo and their lesser relative size in the adult. but if each step of the process of reduction were to be inherited not at the corresponding age but at an extremely early period of life as we have good reason to believe to be possible the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost and we should have a case of complete abortion. the the materials forming any part or structure if not useful to the possessor will be saved as far as is possible will probably often come into play and this will tend to cause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ. as the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every part of the organisation which has long existed to be inheritedwe can understand on the genealogical view of classification how it is that systematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as or even sometimes more useful than parts of high physiological importance. rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word still retained in the spelling but become useless in the pronunciation but which serve as a clue in seeking for its derivation. on the view of descent with modification we may conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary imperfect and useless condition or quite aborted far from presenting a strange difficulty as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation might even have been anticipated and can be accounted for by the laws of inheritance. subordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time that the nature of the relationship by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex radiating and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications the value set upon characters if constant and prevalent whether of high vital importance or of the most trifling importance or as in rudimentary organs of no importance the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters and characters of true affinity and other such rulesall naturally follow on the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by naturalists as allied together with their modification through natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. in considering this view of classification it should be borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking together the sexes ages and acknowledged varieties of the same species however different they may be in structure. if we extend the use of this element of descentthe only certainly known cause of similarity in organic beingswe shall understand what is meant by the natural system it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties species genera families orders and classes. on this same view of descent with modification all the great facts in morphology become intelligiblewhether we look to the same pattern displayed in the homologous organs to whatever purpose applied of the different species of a class or to the homologous parts constructed on the same pattern in each individual animal and plant. on the principle of successive slight variations not necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of life and being inherited at a corresponding period we can understand the great leading facts in embryology namely the resemblance in an individual embryo of the homologous parts which when matured will become widely different from each other in structure and function and the resemblance in different species of a class of the homologous parts or organs though fitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible. larv are active embryos which have become specially modified in relation to their habits of life through the principle of modifications being inherited at corresponding ages. on this same principleand bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size either from disuse or selection it will generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of inheritancethe occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion present to us no inexplicable difficulties on the contrary their presence might have been even anticipated. the importance of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible on the view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical. finally the several classes of facts which have been considered in species genera and families of organic beings with which this world is peopled have all descended each within its own class or group from common parents and have all been modified in the course of descent that i should without hesitation adopt this view even if it were unsupported by other facts or arguments.   recapitulation and conclusion.  recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of natural selection. recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour. causes of the general belief in the immutability of species. how far the theory of natural selection may be extended. effects of its adoption on the study of natural history. concluding remarks.  as this whole volume is one long argument it may be convenient to the reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated. that many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of descent with modification through natural selection i do not deny. i have endeavoured to give to them their full force. nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been perfected not by means superior to though analogous with human reason but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations each good for the individual possessor. nevertheless this difficulty though appearing to our imagination insuperably great cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions namelythat gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct which we may consider either do now exist or could have existed each good of its kindthat all organs and instincts are in ever so slight a degree variableand lastly that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct. the truth of these propositions cannot i think be disputed.  it is no doubt extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations many structures have been perfected more especially amongst broken and failing groups of organic beings but we see so many strange gradations in nature as is proclaimed by the canon natura non facit saltum that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct or any whole being could not have arrived at its present state by many graduated steps. there are it must be admitted cases of special difficulty on the theory of natural selection and one of the most curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile females in the same community of ants but i have attempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered. with respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed i must refer the reader to the which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. we see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the result when the same two species are crossed reciprocally that is when one species is first used as the father and then as the mother. the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring cannot be considered as universal nor is their very general fertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely that either their constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly modified. moreover most of the varieties which have been experimentised on have been produced under domestication and as domestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility we ought not to expect it also to produce sterility. the sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first crosses for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally impotent whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a perfect condition. as we continually see that organisms of all kinds are rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been disturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life we need not feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile for their constitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded of two distinct organisations. this parallelism is supported by another parallel but directly opposite class of facts namely that the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in their conditions of life and that the offspring of slightly modified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility. so that on the one hand considerable changes in the conditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms lessen fertility and on the other hand lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less modified forms increase fertility. turning to geographical distribution the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with modification are grave enough. all the individuals of the same species and all the species of the same genus or even higher group must have descended from common parents and therefore in however distant and isolated parts of the world they are now found they must in the course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the others. we are often wholly unable even to conjecture how this could have been effected. yet as we have reason to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for very long periods enormously long as measured by years too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same species for during very long periods of time there will always be a good chance for wide migration by many means. a broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the intermediate regions. it cannot be denied that we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern periods and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated migration. as an example i have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of the glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of representative species throughout the world. we are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transport. with respect to distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions as the process of modification has necessarily been slow all the means of migration will have been possible during a very long period and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same genus is in some degree lessened. as on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of intermediate forms must have existed linking together all the species in each group by gradations as fine as our present varieties it may be asked why do we not see these linking forms all around us? why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? with respect to existing forms we should remember that we have no right to expect excepting in rare cases to discover directly connecting links between them but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form. even on a wide area which has during a long period remained continuous and of which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in going from a district occupied by one species into another district occupied by a closely allied species we have no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone. for we have reason to believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period and all changes are slowly effected. i have also shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the intermediate zones will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on either hand and the latter from existing in greater numbers will generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate varieties which exist in lesser numbers so that the intermediate varieties will in the long run be supplanted and exterminated. on this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species why is not every geological formation charged with such links? why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life? we meet with no such evidence and this is the most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urged against my theory. why again do whole groups of allied species appear though certainly they often falsely appear to have come in suddenly on the several geological stages? why do we not find great piles of strata beneath the silurian system stored with the remains of the progenitors of the silurian groups of fossils? for certainly on my theory such strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in the worlds history. i can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe. it cannot be objected that there has not been time sufficient for any amount of organic change for the lapse of time has been so great as to be utterly inappreciable by the human intellect. the number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species which certainly have existed. we should not be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or more species if we were to examine them ever so closely unless we likewise possessed many of the intermediate links between their past or parent and present states and these many links we could hardly ever expect to discover owing to the imperfection of the geological record. numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably varieties but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered that naturalists will be able to decide on the common view whether or not these doubtful forms are varieties? as long as most of the links between any two species are unknown if any one link or intermediate variety be discovered it will simply be classed as another and distinct species. only a small portion of the world has been geologically explored. only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition at least in any great number. widely ranging species vary most and varieties are often at first localboth causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links less likely. local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved and when they do spread if discovered in a geological formation they will appear as if suddenly created there and will be simply classed as new species. most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation and their duration i am inclined to believe has been shorter than the average duration of specific forms. successive formations are separated from each other by enormous blank intervals of time for fossiliferous formations thick enough to resist future degradation can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. during the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will be blank. during these latter periods there will probably be more variability in the forms of life during periods of subsidence more extinction. with respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest silurian strata i can only recur to the hypothesis given in the but that it is imperfect to the degree which i require few will be inclined to admit. if we look to long enough intervals of time geology plainly declares that all species have changed and they have changed in the manner which my theory requires for they have changed slowly and in a graduated manner. we clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to each other than are the fossils from formations distant from each other in time. such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may justly be urged against my theory and i have now briefly recapitulated the answers and explanations which can be given to them. i have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many years to doubt their weight. but it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant nor do we know how ignorant we are. we do not know all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect organs it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied means of distribution during the long lapse of years or that we know how imperfect the geological record is. grave as these several difficulties are in my judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent with modification. now let us turn to the other side of the argument. under domestication we see much variability. this seems to be mainly due to the reproductive system being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life so that this system when not rendered impotent fails to reproduce offspring exactly like the parentform. variability is governed by many complex lawsby correlation of growth by use and disuse and by the direct action of the physical conditions of life. there is much difficulty in ascertaining how much modification our domestic productions have undergone but we may safely infer that the amount has been large and that modifications can be inherited for long periods. as long as the conditions of life remain the same we have reason to believe that a modification which has already been inherited for many generations may continue to be inherited for an almost infinite number of generations. on the other hand we have evidence that variability when it has once come into play does not wholly cease for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our most anciently domesticated productions. man does not actually produce variability he only unintentionally exposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts on the organisation and causes variability. but man can and does select the variations given to him by nature and thus accumulate them in any desired manner. he thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure. he may do this methodically or he may do it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful to him at the time without any thought of altering the breed. it is certain that he can largely influence the character of a breed by selecting in each successive generation individual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an uneducated eye. this process of selection has been the great agency in the production of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds. that many of the breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural species is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species. there is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. in the preservation of favoured individuals and races during the constantlyrecurrent struggle for existence we see the most powerful and everacting means of selection. the struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings. this high rate of increase is proved by calculation by the effects of a succession of peculiar seasons and by individuals are born than can possibly survive. a grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall diewhich variety or species shall increase in number and which shall decrease or finally become extinct. as the individuals of the same species come in all respects into the closest competition with each other the struggle will generally be most severe between them it will be almost equally severe between the varieties of the same species and next in severity between the species of the same genus. but the struggle will often be very severe between beings most remote in the scale of nature. the slightest advantage in one being at any age or during any season over those with which it comes into competition or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions will turn the balance. with animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle between the males for possession of the females. the most vigorous individuals or those which have most successfully struggled with their conditions of life will generally leave most progeny. but success will often depend on having special weapons or means of defence or on the charms of the males and the slightest advantage will lead to victory. as geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical changes we might have expected that organic beings would have varied under nature in the same way as they generally have varied under the changed conditions of domestication. and if there be any variability under nature it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play. it has often been asserted but the assertion is quite incapable of proof that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity. man though acting on external characters alone and often capriciously can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere individual differences in his domestic productions and every one admits that there are at least individual differences in species under nature. but besides such differences all naturalists have admitted the existence of varieties which they think sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works. no one can draw any clear distinction between individual differences and slight varieties or between more plainly marked varieties and subspecies and species. let it be observed how naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many representative forms in europe and north america. if then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready to act and select why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to beings under their excessively complex relations of life would be preserved accumulated and inherited? why if man can by patience select variations most useful to himself should nature fail in selecting variations useful under changing conditions of life to her living products? what limit can be put to this power acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution structure and habits of each creaturefavouring the good and rejecting the bad? i can see no limit to this power in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life. the theory of natural selection even if we looked no further than this seems to me to be in itself probable. i have already recapitulated as fairly as i could the opposed difficulties and objections now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of the theory. on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties and that each species first existed as a variety we can see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws. on this same view we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of a genus have been produced and where they now flourish these same species should present many varieties for where the manufactory of species has been active we might expect as a general rule to find it still in action and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. moreover the species of the larger genera which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species retain to a certain degree the character of varieties for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera. the closely allied species also of the larger genera apparently have restricted ranges and they are clustered in little groups round other speciesin which respects they resemble varieties. these are strange relations on the view of each species having been independently created but are intelligible if all species first existed as varieties. as each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase inordinately in number and as the modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become more diversified in habits and structure so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature there will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species. hence during a longcontinued course of modification the slight differences characteristic of varieties of the same species tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of the same genus. new and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older less improved and intermediate varieties and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects. dominant species belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant forms so that each large group tends to become still larger and at the same time more divergent in character. but as all groups cannot thus succeed in increasing in size for the world would not hold them the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. this tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character together with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction explains the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to groups all within a few great classes which we now see everywhere around us and which has prevailed throughout all time. this grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the theory of creation. as natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations it can produce no great or sudden modification it can act only by very short and slow steps. hence the canon of natura non facit saltum which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make more strictly correct is on this theory simply intelligible. we can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety though niggard in innovation. but why this should be a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man can explain. many other facts are as it seems to me explicable on this theory. how strange it is that a bird under the form of woodpecker should have been created to prey on insects on the ground that upland geese which never or rarely swim should have been created with webbed feet that a thrush should have been created to dive and feed on subaquatic insects and that a petrel should have been created with habits and structure fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe! and so on in endless other cases. but on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in number with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of each to any unoccupied or illoccupied place in nature these facts cease to be strange or perhaps might even have been anticipated. as natural selection acts by competition it adapts the inhabitants of each country only in relation to the degree of perfection of their associates so that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of any one country although on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and adapted for that country being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised productions from another land. nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not as far as we can judge absolutely perfect and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. we need not marvel at the sting of the bee causing the bees own death at drones being produced in such vast numbers for one single act and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters at the astonishing waste of pollen by our firtrees at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters at ichneumonid feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars and at other such cases. the wonder indeed is on the theory of natural selection that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been observed. the complex and little known laws governing variation are the same as far as we can see with the laws which have governed the production of socalled specific forms. in both cases physical conditions seem to have produced but little direct effect yet when varieties enter any zone they occasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper to that zone. in both varieties and species use and disuse seem to have produced some effect for it is difficult to resist this conclusion when we look for instance at the loggerheaded duck which has wings incapable of flight in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck or when we look at the burrowing tucutucu which is occasionally blind and then at certain moles which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with skin or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of america and europe. in both varieties and species correlation of growth seems to have played a most important part so that when one part has been modified other parts are necessarily modified. in both varieties and species reversions to longlost characters occur. how inexplicable on the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the several species of the horsegenus and in their hybrids! how simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have descended from a striped progenitor in the same manner as the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rockpigeon! on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why should the specific characters or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other be more variable than the generic characters in which they all agree? why for instance should the colour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus if the other species supposed to have been created independently have differently coloured flowers than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured flowers? if species are only wellmarked varieties of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent we can understand this fact for they have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other and therefore these same characters would be more likely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an enormous period. it is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus and therefore as we may naturally infer of great importance to the species should be eminently liable to variation but on my view this part has undergone since the several species branched off from a common progenitor an unusual amount of variability and modification and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable. but a part may be developed in the most unusual manner like the wing of a bat and yet not be more variable than any other structure if the part be common to many subordinate forms that is if it has been inherited for a very long period for in this case it will have been rendered constant by longcontinued natural selection. glancing at instincts marvellous as some are they offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight but profitable modifications. we can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts. i have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hivebee. habit no doubt sometimes comes into play in modifying instincts but it certainly is not indispensable as we see in the case of neuter insects which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of longcontinued habit. on the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent and having inherited much in common we can understand how it is that allied species when placed under considerably different conditions of life yet should follow nearly the same instincts why the thrush of south america for instance lines her nest with mud like our british species. on the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection we need not marvel at some instincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer. if species be only wellmarked and permanent varieties we can at once see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parentsin being absorbed into each other by successive crosses and in other such pointsas do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. on the other hand these would be strange facts if species have been independently created and varieties have been produced by secondary laws. if we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree then such facts as the record gives support the theory of descent with modification. new species have come on the stage slowly and at successive intervals and the amount of change after equal intervals of time is widely different in different groups. the extinction of species and of whole groups of species which has played so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world almost inevitably follows on the principle of natural selection for old forms will be supplanted by new and improved forms. neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation has once been broken. the gradual diffusion of dominant forms with the slow modification of their descendants causes the forms of life after long intervals of time to appear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world. the fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils in the formations above and below is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain of descent. the grand fact that all extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings falling either into the same or into intermediate groups follows from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents. as the groups which have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in character the progenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants and thus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is the oftener it stands in some degree intermediate between existing and allied groups. recent forms are generally looked at as being in some vague sense higher than ancient and extinct forms and they are in so far higher as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in the struggle for life. lastly the law of the long endurance of allied forms on the same continentof marsupials in australia of edentata in america and other such casesis intelligible for within a confined country the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent. looking to geographical distribution if we admit that there has been during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to another owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal then we can understand on the theory of descent with modification most of the great leading facts in distribution. we can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space and in their geological succession throughout time for in both cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation and the means of modification have been the same. we see the full meaning of the wonderful fact which must have struck every traveller namely that on the same continent under the most diverse conditions under heat and cold on mountain and lowland on deserts and marshes most of the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related for they will generally be descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. on this same principle of former migration combined in most cases with modification we can understand by the aid of the glacial period the identity of some few plants and the close alliance of many others on the most distant mountains under the most different climates and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern temperate zones though separated by the whole intertropical ocean. although two areas may present the same physical conditions of life we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different if they have been for a long period completely separated from each other for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all relations and as the two areas will have received colonists from some third source or from each other at various periods and in different proportions the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be different. on this view of migration with subsequent modification we can see why oceanic islands should be inhabited by few species but of these that many should be peculiar. we can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross wide spaces of ocean as frogs and terrestrial mammals should not inhabit oceanic islands and why on the other hand new and peculiar species of bats which can traverse the ocean should so often be found on islands far distant from any continent. such facts as the presence of peculiar species of bats and the absence of all other mammals on oceanic islands are utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation. the existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas implies on the theory of descent with modification that the same parents formerly inhabited both areas and we almost invariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas some identical species common to both still exist. wherever many closely allied yet distinct species occur many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species likewise occur. it is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence immigrants might have been derived. we see this in nearly all the plants and animals of the galapagos archipelago of juan fernandez and of the other american islands being related in the most striking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring american mainland and those of the cape de verde archipelago and other african islands to the african mainland. it must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of creation. the fact as we have seen that all past and present organic beings constitute one grand natural system with group subordinate to group and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. on these same principles we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so complex and circuitous. we see why certain characters are far more serviceable than others for classificationwhy adaptive characters though of paramount importance to the being are of hardly any importance in classification why characters derived from rudimentary parts though of no service to the being are often of high classificatory value and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all. the real affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community of descent. the natural system is a genealogical arrangement in which we have to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters however slight their vital importance may be. the framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man wing of a bat fin of the porpoise and leg of the horsethe same number of vertebr forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephantand innumerable other such facts at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications. the similarity of pattern in the wing and leg of a bat though used for such different purposein the jaws and legs of a crabin the petals stamens and pistils of a flower is likewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs which were alike in the early progenitor of each class. on the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals birds reptiles and fishes should be so closely alike and should be so unlike the adult forms. we may cease marvelling at the embryo of an airbreathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of welldeveloped branchi. disuse aided sometimes by natural selection will often tend to reduce an organ when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed conditions of life and we can clearly understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs. but disuse and selection will generally act on each creature when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence and will thus have little power of acting on an organ during early life hence the organ will not be much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. the calf for instance has inherited teeth which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw from an early progenitor having welldeveloped teeth and we may believe that the teeth in the mature animal were reduced during successive generations by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid whereas in the calf the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the present day. on the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created how utterly inexplicable it is that parts like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wingcovers of some beetles should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures her scheme of modification which it seems that we wilfully will not understand. i have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have thoroughly convinced me that species have changed and are still slowly changing by the preservation and accumulation of successive slight favourable variations. why it may be asked have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species? it cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no variation it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity no clear distinction has been or can be drawn between species and wellmarked varieties. it cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile or that sterility is a special endowment and sign of creation. the belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of short duration and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time we are too apt to assume without proof that the geological record is so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species if they had undergone mutation. but the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. the difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists when lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed and great valleys excavated by the slow action of the coastwaves. the mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations. although i am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume under the form of an abstract i by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed during a long course of years from a point of view directly opposite to mine. it is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the plan of creation unity of design etc. and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory. a few naturalists endowed with much flexibility of mind and who have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species may be influenced by this volume but i look with confidence to the future to young and rising naturalists who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed. several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species but that other species are real that is have been independently created. this seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. they admit that a multitude of forms which till lately they themselves thought were special creations and which are still thus looked at by the majority of naturalists and which consequently have every external characteristic feature of true speciesthey admit that these have been produced by variation but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms. nevertheless they do not pretend that they can define or even conjecture which are the created forms of life and which are those produced by secondary laws. they admit variation as a vera causa in one case they arbitrarily reject it in another without assigning any distinction in the two cases. the day will come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion. these authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. but do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earths history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed or as full grown? and in the case of mammals were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mothers womb? although naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability of species on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they consider reverent silence. it may be asked how far i extend the doctrine of the modification of species. the question is difficult to answer because the more distinct the forms are which we may consider by so much the arguments fall away in force. but some arguments of the greatest weight extend very far. all the members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of affinities and all can be classified on the same principle in groups subordinate to groups. fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between existing orders. organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed state and this in some instances necessarily implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants. throughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same pattern and at an embryonic age the species closely resemble each other. therefore i cannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same class. i believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors and plants from an equal or lesser number. analogy would lead me one step further namely to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype. but analogy may be a deceitful guide. nevertheless all living things have much in common in their chemical composition their germinal vesicles their cellular structure and their laws of growth and reproduction. we see this even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals or that the poison secreted by the gallfly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oaktree. therefore i should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form into which life was first breathed. when the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species or when analogous views are generally admitted we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history. systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a species. this i feel sure and i speak after experience will be no slight relief. the endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of british brambles are true species will cease. systematists will have only to decide not that this will be easy whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms to be capable of definition and if definable whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name. this latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is at present for differences however slight between any two forms if not blended by intermediate gradations are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species. hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction between species and wellmarked varieties is that the latter are known or believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations whereas species were formerly thus connected. hence without quite rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them. it is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names as with the primrose and cowslip and in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance. in short we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. this may not be a cheering prospect but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species. the other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly in interest. the terms used by naturalists of affinity relationship community of type paternity morphology adaptive characters rudimentary and aborted organs etc. will cease to be metaphorical and will have a plain signification. when we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship as at something wholly beyond his comprehension when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances each useful to the possessor nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour the experience the reason and even the blunders of numerous workmen when we thus view each organic being how far more interesting i speak from experience will the study of natural history become! a grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened on the causes and laws of variation on correlation of growth on the effects of use and disuse on the direct action of external conditions and so forth. the study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. a new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species. our classifications will come to be as far as they can be so made genealogies and will then truly give what may be called the plan of creation. the rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we have a definite object in view. we possess no pedigrees or armorial bearings and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies by characters of any kind which have long been inherited. rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of longlost structures. species and groups of species which are called aberrant and which may fancifully be called living fossils will aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life. embryology will reveal to us the structure in some degree obscured of the prototypes of each great class. when we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species and all the closely allied species of most genera have within a not very remote period descended from one parent and have migrated from some one birthplace and when we better know the many means of migration then by the light which geology now throws and will continue to throw on former changes of climate and of the level of the land we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. even at present by comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent and the nature of the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of immigration some light can be thrown on ancient geography. the noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. the crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a wellfilled museum but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. the accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence of circumstances and the blank intervals between the successive stages as having been of vast duration. but we shall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms. we must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneous two formations which include few identical species by the general succession of their forms of life. as species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions namely the mutual relation of organism to organismthe improvement of one being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others it follows that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time. a number of species however keeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged whilst within this same period several of these species by migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign associates might become modified so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time. during early periods of the earths history when the forms of life were probably fewer and simpler the rate of change was probably slower and at the first dawn of life when very few forms of the simplest structure existed the rate of change may have been slow in an extreme degree. the whole history of the world as at present known although of a length quite incomprehensible by us will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time compared with the ages which have elapsed since the first creature the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living descendants was created. in the distant future i see open fields for far more important researches. psychology will be based on a new foundation that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history. authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. to my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the creator that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes like those determining the birth and death of the individual. when i view all beings not as special creations but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited they seem to me to become ennobled. judging from the past we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. and of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped shows that the greater number of species of each genus and all the species of many genera have left no descendants but have become utterly extinct. we can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it will be the common and widelyspread species belonging to the larger and dominant groups which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. as all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the silurian epoch we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. and as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection. it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds with birds singing on the bushes with various insects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms so different from each other and dependent on each other in so complex a manner have all been produced by laws acting around us. these laws taken in the largest sense being growth with reproduction inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life and from use and disuse a ratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life and as a consequence to natural selection entailing divergence of character and the extinction of lessimproved forms. thus from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving namely the production of the higher animals directly follows. there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.   index.

    "\n",
    "1. Split the corpus into sentences *Using a full stop as the delimiter*\n",
    "2. Calculate the length of the padding needed\n",
    "    - Think about how many words are needed to create the first N-gram **of length N**? *Hint: The first actual word is included*\n",
    "3. Create the padding for the front and end using for example `\" \".join(list_of_start_chars)`\n",
    "    - In Python you can create a list of length pad_len using `[el] * pad_len`\n",
    "4. Pad each corpus sentence ensuring that there is a space between the padding and sentence\n",

    "Split the padded sentences into words and return a list of lists containing the split sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **💻 2.3 Complete the `create_n_grams` function to create N-grams with length of the parameter `N` based on the tokinzed sentences. You can use the following approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and empty list for the n_grams\n",
    "2. Loop across all the tokenized sentences\n",
    "3. Now loop across the range of applicable starting indexes for the given sentence\n",
    "    - If N = 2, what's the length of the sentences list and how many N_grams can we create? Generalise this.\n",
    "4. Create the current n_gram by using `\" \".join`\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise we saw how to tokenize a corpus such that it is ready to be split into n-grams. We then saw how to make n-grams and create a conditional probability based on these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question now is, how can we generate a text using this conditional probability. A way of doing this is to sample from a conditional probability distribution based on our obtained N-grams. In essence, we can give a seed to our conditional probability (also called a context), and then we need to generate a word from our conditional probability by sampling from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we will define a function that allows us to generate a sentence based on a provided conditional distribution. In the cell we create such a conditional distribution and generate 5 sentences using the same text seed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4.1. 💻 Implement the `generate_text` function. Given a seed start text and some context probabilities (as created by the previous exercises), it should generate additional text.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use  following as help to implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable which will be the output string and assign the text_seed to it\n",
    "2. Split the text_seed into words and check its length, it should be N-1\n",
    "    - If the text seed is too short append the start character to it\n",
    "    - If the text seed is too long change it to the last N-1 words\n",
    "3. Create a variable that holds the current context (text_seed right now)\n",
    "4. Loop across the number of words we wish to generate\n",
    "   - If the current context is not in the `cond_prob` dictionary, return the generated sentence\n",
    "   - If it is, sample a target word from the context according to its probability distribution and update the context for the next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4.2. Answer the following questions about the text generation you have just implemented:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is it that even though we use the same text seed, the generated sentences changes?\n",
    "2. What happens as you increase the N-gram size as shown in the cell below? Does this makes sense - and if so, why?\n",
    "3. Is it more optimal to have smaller or larger N-gram size? Try to experiment with generated sentences as N goes from 2->7.\n",
    "4. What would it mean to set the N-gram size to one? What would you expect the generated text to look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #00590D; padding:8px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #4682b4\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because we are sampling from the distribution and not simply using the most probable word.\n",
    "2. There are fewer and fewer examples of each context in the text which leads to less text being generated.\n",
    "3. The higher the n-gram size the fewer examples of each n-gram there is.\n",
    "4. There is not target for any context so no text is generated.\n",
